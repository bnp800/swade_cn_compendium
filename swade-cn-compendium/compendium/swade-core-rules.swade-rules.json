To help the Game Master keep track of who goes in what order and add a little randomness to the game, we use a single deck of playing cards with both Jokers left in to determine everyone&rsquo;s initiative order. We call these &ldquo;Action Cards.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The GM can deal cards face up or face down as she sees fit. She might also deal the players&rsquo; cards face up and the villains face down to increase the players&rsquo; tension and uncertainty!</p>\n<p>At the start of each round:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deal each @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.不羁角色与龙套们]{不羁角色} a single Action Card (plus any extra cards for @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.专长]{专长}). Allies under a player&rsquo;s control act on his Action Card.</li>\n<li>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.不羁角色与龙套们]{龙套}, such as all zombies, all wolves, and so on, should usually share an Action Card so they act at the same time. This makes them much easier to manage. She can also group Wild Cards with their minions if she wants. The goal is to do whatever makes running the battle as quick and easy as possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Shuffle: </strong>Shuffle the deck after any round in which a Joker was dealt.</p>\n<p><strong>Large Groups: </strong>In very large groups or time-sensitive games, the Game Master can deal a single card per side (heroes and villains). On the heroes&rsquo; turn, simply start at one end of the group and work quickly around. This speeds things up dramatically if that&rsquo;s more important than varying initiative order. If one or more characters have @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-edges.沉稳冷静]{沉稳冷静} or @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-edges.迅捷]{迅捷}, let that apply to the draw (but only once).</p>\n<h3>The Countdown</h3>\n<p>Once the cards are dealt, the Game Master starts the round by counting down from Ace down to Two, with each group resolving its actions when its card comes up.</p>\n<p><strong>Ties: </strong>Ties are resolved by suit order: Spades &spades; are first, then Hearts <span class=\"red-text\">&hearts;</span>, Diamonds <span class=\"red-text\">&diams;</span>, and Clubs &clubs;. That&rsquo;s reverse alphabetical order as used in many common card games.</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>JOKERS: </strong>Characters (or groups) with a Joker act whenever they want in the round, even interrupting another&rsquo;s action. They also add +2 to all @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性]{特性} and @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.伤害]{伤害} rolls this round!</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

A roll less than 4 means the power doesn&rsquo;t activate. The caster spends one @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.奥法背景]{奇术点} regardless of any @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.专长]{专长} such as @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-edges.导能]{导能}, unless the ability specifically says it reduces the minimum cost to 0.</p>\n<p>A roll of 4 or higher means the power activates and consumes all the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.奥法背景]{奇术点} allocated to it, even if it misses the target (such as with <em>bolt</em>), or the defender resists.</p>\n<p>Success means the hero spends the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.奥法背景]{奇术点} and resolves the power&rsquo;s effects. A @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性投骰]{优良} has additional effects noted in the particular power description.</p>\n<p><strong>Backlash:</strong> A @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性投骰]{大失败} when activating a power is called Backlash. It causes a level of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.疲乏]{疲乏} and all currently active powers instantly terminate.</p>\n<p><strong>Group Rolls:</strong> The GM can choose to make <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性投骰]{Group Rolls}</strong> when large numbers of nonplayer characters are affected by a power. It&rsquo;s useful to roll damage against each group of like targets sepa&shy;rately in an @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.范围效果攻击]{范围效果攻击}, for example, but to roll sepa&shy;rately for those trying to escape an entangle or similar power.</p>\n<h3>Casting Requirements</h3>\n<p>A character must be able to see his target and cannot be <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.束缚与纠缠]{束缚}</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Maintaining Powers</h3>\n<p>It costs 1 @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.奥法背景]{奇术点} to maintain a power for its base @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.奇术]{持续时间}. If a power&rsquo;s Duration is five rounds, for example, it can be maintained for another five @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.战斗]{轮} for 1 Power Point.</p>\n<p>Maintenance is per target but ignores other @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.奇术调整]{奇术调整}, so renewing @<em>Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-powers.Boost/Lower Trait]{Boost Trait}</em> on three allies costs 3 @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.奥法背景]{获得奇术点} and extends the effect of each another five rounds.</p>\n<p>Unless a power says otherwise, the caster can terminate it as a free action.</p>\n<h3>Recharging</h3>\n<p>A character recovers 5 @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.奥法背景]{获得奇术点} per hour spent resting, meditating, etc. What constitutes &ldquo;rest&rdquo; is up to the GM, but they do not recharge while powers are maintained, or during anything more than mild physical exertion, emotional stress, or mental distraction. A hero can rest while riding a horse, for example, unless the animal is restless, the road is terribly bumpy, traffic requires frequent concentration, etc.</p>\n<p>Heroes can also regain @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.奥法背景]{获得奇术点} while walking if the conditions are generally favorable and the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.移动]{移速} is leisurely.</p>\n<h3>Powers as Multi-Actions</h3>\n<p>Each power activated is its own @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.动作]{动作}, and the same or dif&shy;ferent powers may be cast multiple times as a <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.复合动作]{Multi-Action}</strong>. A wizard in a fantasy setting might open combat by invoking <em>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-powers.防护]{防护}</em>&nbsp;and <em>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-powers.偏斜]{偏斜}</em>, for exam&shy;ple, or a priest might attempt to <em>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-powers.放逐]{放逐}</em>&nbsp;a spirit while invoking <em>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-powers.痛击]{痛击}</em> on his @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-equipment.硬头锤]{硬头锤}.</p>\n<h3>Shorting</h3>\n<p>A character may cast a power with <em>fewer</em> @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.奥法背景]{获得奇术点} than it requires (whether she has them or not) by increasing the difficulty of her @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.奥法背景]{奥法} skill roll.</p>\n<p>For every Power Point a character will short, she suffers a &minus;1 penalty to the roll. Casting a 3-point <em>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-powers.医疗]{医疗}</em>&nbsp;with 0 Power Points, for example, inflicts a &minus;3 penalty.</p>\n<p>Shorting is risky.

			"description": "<div class=\"swade-core\">\n<div class=\"section-header\">\n<h1>Advancement</h1>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>One of the many great aspects of roleplaying games is advancing your character, watching her grow from a Novice to a Legendary hero.</p>\n<p>Advancement in <cite>Savage Worlds</cite> depends on the length of your intended campaign. For short campaigns of 10 sessions or fewer, we recommend characters Advance after each session. In a One Shot, you might even want to allow an Advance in the <em>middle</em> of the adventure, especially if there&rsquo;s some downtime or a narrative opportunity that makes sense.</p>\n<p>You can slow things down for longer campaigns by granting an Advance every other session, or even every third session if you intend on playing for years. You can even decide to grant Advances after certain objectives are met&mdash;it&rsquo;s completely in the hands of the Game Master.</p>\n<p>An Advance lets a character do one of the following. Remember that no @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性]{特性} may be raised above its racial maximum (usually d12).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gain a new @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.专长]{专长.</li>\n<li>Increase a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性]{技能} that is equal to or greater than its linked attribute one die type.</li>\n<li>Increase two skills that are lower than their linked attributes by one die type each (including new skills the character didn&rsquo;t have before at d4).</li>\n<li>Increase one attribute by a die type. This option may only be taken once per Rank (see <strong>Rank</strong>, below). Legendary characters may raise an attribute every other Advance, up to the racial maximum.</li>\n<li>Permanently remove a Minor @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.负赘]{负赘}, or reduce a Major Hindrance to a Minor (if possible). With the GM&rsquo;s permission, and if it makes sense, two Advances may be saved up and spent to remove a Hindrance. The player and GM should work out how and when this happens. Perhaps the shocking death of an ally triggers a change in attitude, the hero puts real effort into improving harmful behavior, or might even seek professional help during downtime between missions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Rank</h2>\n<p>As a character gains Advances, she goes up in &ldquo;Rank.&rdquo; This is a rough measure of how powerful she is. Each Rank allows access to more powerful @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.专长]{专长} and certain abilities (such as @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.奇术]{奇术})!</p>\n<table class=\"table value-table\"><caption class=\"table-caption\">\n<h2 class=\"table-title\">Rank</h2>\n</caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"table-header-row\">\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Advances</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Rank</th>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>0-3</td>\n<td>Novice</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4-7</td>\n<td>Seasoned</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8-11</td>\n<td>Veteran</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12-15</td>\n<td>Heroic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16+</td>\n<td>Legendary</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Starting with experienced characters</h3>\n<p>If the GM wants to start a game with more experienced characters, you should still make a Novice and Advance it normally. This ensures characters are balanced just as if they had gained experience normally.</p>\n<p>Additional goods, equipment, or other assets must be determined by the Game Master and the particular setting. As a quick rule of thumb, a character&rsquo;s starting funds double with each Rank after Novice.</p>\n<p><strong>Replacement Characters:</strong> When a character dies, we recommend the player create a new Novice hero then give him the same number of Advances his previous champion had when he fell.</p>\n<h3>Allies &amp; Advancement</h3>\n<p>Followers and other allies who stay with the party for extended periods can improve their abilities as well.</p>\n<p>At the end of a game session in which the allies had a significant role (usually by participating in combat, but GM&rsquo;s call), Advance them just as you would the player characters.</p>\n<img src=\"modules/swade-core-rules/assets/art/pg54_quote_advancement.webp\" alt=\"It's always a good idea to increase an attribute.

			"description": "<div class=\"swade-core\">\n<div class=\"section-header\">\n<h1>Allies</h1>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Allies play a big part in many <cite>Savage Worlds</cite> games. They serve as troops under your hero&rsquo;s command in <cite>Weird Wars</cite>, loyal retainers in fantasy settings, or fellow fighters in glorious rebellions against oppression.</p>\n<p><strong>When to Use These Rules:</strong> Use these rules to help keep track of the party&rsquo;s followers and give them a little extra personality to play off of as well.</p>\n<p><strong>The Basics: </strong>Players create, control, and track their own followers and nonplayer character allies.</p>\n<h2>Using Allies</h2>\n<p>Keeping up with allies in <cite>Savage Worlds</cite> is simple. Just download the <a title=\"Ally Sheet\" href=\"https://www.peginc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Ally-Sheet.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ally Sheet</a> from our website and fill in the blanks.</p>\n<p>Allied @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.不羁角色与龙套们]{龙套} are divided up among all the players to control. This is a very important part of <cite>Savage Worlds</cite> because our settings often feature allied bands of skilled hirelings, fellow grunts, or loyal retainers, and the game is designed to handle them quickly and easily. It&rsquo;s also designed for the players to control them&mdash;not the Game Master.</p>\n<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether or not the <em>characters</em> control the allies, only that the players do. This keeps everyone involved in the action even if his hero is out of the fight, and makes running large combats much easier and more fun for everyone. Of course the GM can always take charge of Extras when the need arises, but with good roleplayers this should rarely be necessary.</p>\n<h3>Allied Personalities</h3>\n<p>You can add a little flavor to your allies by rolling on the <strong>Allied Personalities</strong> table. Jot down the keyword on the Ally Sheet so you and your Game Master have a little insight into each particular ally&rsquo;s character.</p>\n<p>Consider these general impressions with no particular game effect. They help both the player and GM decide just how an ally might react in a given situation. In a <cite>Weird War Two</cite> game, for instance, a player with a young lieutenant character could look over his list and choose the &ldquo;Observant&rdquo; character to pull guard duty. If he has to go with the &ldquo;Lazy&rdquo; soldier for some reason, there&rsquo;s a good chance the GM will rule he falls asleep sometime during his watch.</p>\n<table class=\"table list-table\"><caption class=\"table-caption\">\n<h2 class=\"table-title\">Allied Personalities</h2>\n</caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"table-header-row\">\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">D20</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Personality</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">D20</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Personality</th>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Treacherous</td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>Crude</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Cruel</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>Agile</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Old</td>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>Observant</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Happy</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>Clueless</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Experienced</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>Mysterious</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Gung-Ho</td>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>Creative</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>Lazy</td>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>Artistic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>Sneaky</td>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>Fearless</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>Bright</td>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>Cowardly</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>Young</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>Heroic</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br /><img src=\"modules/swade-core-rules/assets/art/pg112_quote_allies.webp\" alt=\"How come I always get the clueless ones? &mdash; Red\" /> <br />\n<h3>Allies &amp; Advancement</h3>\n<p>Allies can improve their abilities as well. See <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.升级]{升级}</strong>.</p>\n<h3>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.弹药 Table]{弹药}</h3>\n<p>Keeping track of ammo for all your allies can be difficult. Here&rsquo;s an easy and dramatic way to handle this problem.</p>\n<p>The ammo level of each group of allied Extras starts at Very High, High (the usual level), Low, or Out, as determined by the GM.</p>\n<p>After each fight, the ammo automatically drops a level. This makes for dramatic situations and realistic logistical problems while eliminating the bookkeeping.</p>\n<p>The GM can always decide otherwise, of course. Perhaps the troops are told to fight with hand weapons instead of their firearms, or they don&rsquo;t get to fire off more than a couple of shots before the fight is over.</p>\n<h2>Typical Allies</h2>\n<p>Here are a few typical soldier archetypes you might use for your Savage Worlds games.

They may only be used on your own character.</p>\n<p>Here are the ways characters can use their Bennies.</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>REROLL A TRAIT: </strong>Bennies grant a hero a reroll on <em>any</em> @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性]{特性}, and best of all, you get to keep the <em>best</em> total from all your rolls. The only exception is a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性投骰]{大失败}, which ends the attempt and must be accepted. Such is the price of tempting fate!</li>\n<li><strong>RECOVER FROM @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.伤害效果]{动摇}: </strong>This is instant and may be done at any time, even interrupting another&rsquo;s actions if desired.</li>\n<li><strong>SOAK ROLLS: </strong>Bennies can also be used to prevent @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.伤害效果]{损伤} or recover from being @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.伤害效果]{动摇}. See <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.化解投骰]{Soak Rolls}</strong> for more information.</li>\n<li><strong>DRAW A NEW ACTION CARD: </strong>When the game is in rounds, a character can spend a Benny to get a new @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.行动卡 (先攻)]{行动卡}. This occurs after all cards are dealt and @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.专长]{专长} or @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.负赘]{负赘} like Quick, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-edges.沉稳冷静]{沉稳冷静}, or Hesitant are resolved. <em>Then</em> players or the GM may spend Bennies for an additional card as many times as they like and take their choice of all their draws. @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.专长]{专长} like @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-edges.迅捷]{迅捷} or @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-edges.沉稳冷静]{沉稳冷静} <em>do not</em> apply to these additional cards drawn with Bennies. This continues until everyone (including the GM) passes. Then the round begins and no further cards may be drawn.</li>\n<li><strong>REROLL DAMAGE: </strong>You may spend a Benny to reroll @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.伤害]{伤害}. Include any additional dice you may have gained for a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性投骰]{优良} on the attack roll.</li>\n<li><strong>REGAIN POWER POINTS: </strong>A character with an @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.奥法背景]{奥法背景} can spend a Benny to regain 5 @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.奥法背景]{获得奇术点}.</li>\n<li><strong>INFLUENCE THE STORY: </strong>This one is entirely up to the Game Master, who may allow your character to spend a Benny to find an additional clue if you&rsquo;re stuck, come up with some mundane but needed item, or push a nonplayer character into being a bit more agreeable.</li>\n</ul>\n<img src=\"modules/swade-core-rules/assets/art/pg90_quote_bennies.webp\" alt=\"Let the Bennies flow! Players tend to surprise you when they have a little more control over the game. &mdash; The GM.\" />\n<aside class=\"awarding-bennies-aside\">\n<h2>Awarding Bennies</h2>\n<p>It takes a few games to figure out how many Bennies you should award players during a session. In general, we recommend you be fairly free with them, especially early in the game. If someone makes everyone laugh (and isn&rsquo;t distracting the flow of the game), toss her a Benny. When someone roleplays a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.负赘]{负赘}, reward her. When someone does something clever or heroic or imaginative, acknowledge it with a Benny.</p>\n<p>Some GMs worry the game will become too easy if Bennies are too common, but we find the opposite is true. When Bennies are plentiful, players often spend them on trivial things that are important to <em>them</em>. Maybe the thief <em>really</em> wants to pick the lock on a chest. There&rsquo;s nothing particularly valuable inside and the player probably knows it, but he&rsquo;s the thief and wants to prove himself to the rest of the party.</p>\n<p>When Bennies are scarce, however, players tend to save them for injuries, death, or taking out the big bads. That&rsquo;s fine, but takes away from the fun and heroics that got them to this point. <cite>Savage Worlds</cite> is about big action and players should be encouraged to take chances. The &ldquo;currency&rdquo; of these chances are those Bennies.</p>\n<p>Veteran <cite>Savage Worlds</cite> GMs might also notice Bennies tend to flow fairly fast early on in a session. The group is settling in, laughing, and are rewarded for roleplaying their @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.负赘]{负赘} the first time or two. In the mid-to-late game, Bennies tend to be spent faster than they&rsquo;re gained. That&rsquo;s a fantastic pace. It gives the heroes opportunities to do big things in the early and mid-game then forces some resource management for the final showdown.</p>\n<p>If you find yourself being stingy, go the other way the next time you run and see how it affects your group. Then you&rsquo;ll know what&rsquo;s right for you and your friends.</p>\n</aside>\n<img src=\"modules/swade-core-rules/assets/art/Bennies.webp\" alt=\"A set of five bennies with the Savage Worlds logo, Raygun, Airship, Armor and Shield, and Skull icons.\" /></div>"

To make your hero, download a Savage Worlds character sheet from our website at <a title=\"Pinnacle Entertainment Group, Inc.\" href=\"http://www.peginc.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>www.peginc.com</strong></a> and follow the steps below</p>\n<h2>CONCEPT</h2>\n<p>Published Savage Settings often come with both character ideas and pregenerated &ldquo;Archetypes.&rdquo; You can play these as-is or use them to spark your own ideas.</p>\n<p>You might play an iconic gunslinger in <a title=\"Deadlands: The Weird West\" href=\"https://www.peginc.com/store/deadlands-the-weird-west-core-rules/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Deadlands: The Weird West</em></a>, for example, or you might try something a little different and play the innocent schoolmarm destined to save the town. Look through the player&rsquo;s section of your setting or talk to the GM if it&rsquo;s a world of her own creation to see what kind of character catches your interest.</p>\n<h2>Race</h2>\n<p>Settings may feature everything from humans to strange aliens, graceful elves, or other exotic races. You can choose to play any race available in your particular setting.</p>\n<p>A number of sample races are detailed @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.种族s]{这里}, as well as rules for players and Game Masters to @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Making Races]{create your own}.</p>\n<h2>HINDRANCES</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.负赘]{负赘} are flaws, drawbacks, or dark secrets drawn from a character&rsquo;s backstory.</p>\n<p>You can take up to 4 points of Hindrances. A Major Hindrance is worth 2 points, and a Minor is worth 1. A hero could thus take two Major Hindrances, four Minor, or any combination that adds up to 4 points. (You can take more Hindrances if you want but the maximum benefit is 4 points!)</p>\n<p>Taking Hindrances not only helps you define and roleplay your hero, but also gives you additional points you can use to start with additional attribute or skill points, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.专长]{专长}, or even money for @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.装备注释]{装备}.</p>\n<p><strong>For 2 points you can:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Raise an attribute one die type, or</li>\n<li>Choose an @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.专长]{专长</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>For 1 point you can:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gain another skill point, or</li>\n<li>Gain additional starting funds equal to twice your setting's starting amount (see below)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>TRAITS</h2>\n<p>Characters are defined by attributes and skills, collectively called &ldquo;@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性]{特性},&rdquo; and both work in exactly the same way. Attributes and skills are ranked by die types, typically from d4 to d12, with d6 being the average for adult humans. Higher is better!</p>\n<h3>ATTRIBUTES</h3>\n<p>Every character starts with a d4 in each of five attributes: Agility, Smarts, Spirit, Strength, and Vigor (discussed in more detail @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性]{这里}).</p>\n<p>You then have 5 points to increase your attributes. Raising a d4 to a d6, for example, costs 1 point. You&rsquo;re free to spend these points however you like, except that no attribute may ever be raised above a d12 unless a racial ability says otherwise (such as @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Making Races]{Attribute Increase}). If it does, each increase beyond a d12 adds a +1 modifier. Increasing a d12 Strength two steps, for example, is a Strength score of d12+2.</p>\n<img src=\"modules/swade-core-rules/assets/art/pg10_red.webp\" alt=\"An image of Red and quote 'No matter what setting she's playing, Emily's character is always 'Red'. Red takes on different aspects when she wanders different worlds,but is always strong, smart, and loyal to her friends. She's also curious...a trait that constantly seems to get her in trouble...\" />\n<h3>SKILLS</h3>\n<p>Skills are learned abilities such as firing weapons, hand-to-hand combat, scientific knowledge, professional aptitudes, and so on.</p>\n<p>Skills in <em>Savage Worlds</em> are very broad to keep the action simple and straightforward. The Shooting skill, for example, covers all types of guns, bows, rocket launchers, and other ranged weapons.</p>\n<p><strong>Core Skills:</strong> Five skills are marked with a red star in the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性]{清单}:<strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.运动]{运动}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.通用知识]{通用知识}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.察觉]{察觉}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.交涉]{交涉}</strong>, and <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.潜行]{潜行}</strong>. These are &ldquo;innate&rdquo; abilities most adult adventurers have. Unless a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.种族s]{种族能力}, Edge, or Hindrance says otherwise, your character starts with a d4 in each of these five core skills.</p>\n<p><strong>Buying Skills:</strong> After core skills are assigned, you have 12 additional points to raise core skills or buy and raise new skills as you see fit.</p>\n<p>Each die type costs 1 point (starting at d4) as long as the skill is equal to or less than the attribute it&rsquo;s linked to (listed beside the skill in parentheses in @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性]{特性}). If you exceed the linked attribute, the cost becomes 2 points per die type.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Maximums:</strong> Skills may not be increased above d12 during character creation unless the character&rsquo;s race starts with the skill at d6. If the skill starts with a d6, increase her maximum to d12+1. <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.天民s and Guardians]{天民}</strong> start with a d6 in Faith, for example, which means their Faith skill may be increased to d12+1.</p>\n<h3>DERIVED STATISTICS</h3>\n<p>Your character sheet contains a few other statistics you need to fill in, described below.</p>\n<p><strong>Pace</strong> is how fast your character moves in tactical situations like combat. Standard Pace is 6, which means six tabletop inches per game round. Each inch is two yards in the real world. @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.移动]{移动} is explained in more detail here.</p>\n<p><strong>Parry</strong> is equal to 2 plus half your character&rsquo;s @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.格斗]{格斗} die type (a total of 2 if a character doesn&rsquo;t have Fighting), plus any bonuses for shields or certain weapons. This is the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性投骰]{Target Number} (TN) to hit your hero in hand-to-hand combat.</p>\n<p>For Fighting skills higher than d12, such as d12+1, add half the fixed modifier, rounded down. For instance, Fighting d12+1 grants a Parry of 8, while Fighting d12+2 results in a Parry of 9.</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong>: A hero&rsquo;s default @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.体型和尺寸]{体型} is 0 unless altered by @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.种族s]{racial abilities}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.专长]{专长}, or @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.负赘]{负赘}. It cannot be less than &minus;1 or more than +3.</p>\n<p><strong>Toughness</strong> is your hero&rsquo;s damage thres&shy;hold. @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.伤害]{伤害} rolls that equal or exceed this number cause harm.</p>\n<p>Toughness is 2 plus half your hero&rsquo;s Vigor, plus @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.护甲 Notes]{护甲} (use the armor worn on his torso). Vigor over a d12 is calculated just like Parry, above.</p>\n<h2>EDGES</h2>\n<p>Traits @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性]{Attributes and skills} are a character&rsquo;s basic statistics, but what really makes individuals different are their @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.专长]{专长}. Even two legionaries in <a title=\"Weird Wars Rome\" href=\"https://www.peginc.com/store/weird-wars-rome/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Weird Wars Rome</em></a> with identical Traits play vastly different depending on the Edges they take. One might focus on Leadership Edges that lets him rally his fellow soldiers while another concentrates on taking out large numbers of foes at once with @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-edges.横扫]{横扫} or @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-edges.连击]{连击}.</p>\n<p>Characters get @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.专长]{专长} by taking @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.负赘]{负赘} from @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.种族s]{racial abilities} (such as <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.人类]{Humans' Adpatability})</strong>, or <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.升级]{升级}</strong> once play begins.</p>\n<p>A comprehensive list of Edges is available. Your setting book likely has additional abilities specific to that world or genre as well.</p>\n<h2>GEAR</h2>\n<p>Some settings provide your hero with all the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.装备注释]{装备} she needs. Most simply grant a starting amount of funds you can use to purchase whatever you like from a relevant list of weapons, armor, and adventuring gear.</p>\n<p>Unless your setting book or GM says otherwise, the standard starting amount is $500. A list of common gear and weapons can be found in the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.装备注释]{Chapter Two}.</p>\n<p>Depending on the setting, this might be everything the character owns or it may represent their &ldquo;adventuring&rdquo; gear, with their more mundane belongings stored at a home or apartment. The latter is up to the Game Master. In modern settings, most everyone should have a home, clothes, appliances, and so on. The equipment you list on your character sheet should be your character&rsquo;s &ldquo;adventuring gear&rdquo; rather than an exhaustive list of everything she owns.</p>\n<p>Players don&rsquo;t have to worry about how much they can carry in most games, but if it becomes important, see @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.装备注释]{负载}.</p>\n<img src=\"modules/swade-core-rules/assets/art/pg11_roman.webp\" alt=\"An image of a Roman Centurion with quote 'Roman Centurion...These guys mean business!'\" />\n<h2>BACKGROUND EDGES</h2>\n<p>Finish your new hero by filling in any additional history or background you care to. Ask yourself why she&rsquo;s where she is and what her goals are. Where does she live? Does she have any close friends or family who might be relevant to the game?</p>\n<p>Or just start playing and fill in these details as they become important and you walk around in her shoes a bit.</p>\n<p>You might also want to talk to the other players. Maybe your characters know each other right from the start. Or you might collectively decide to optimize your group a bit and ensure you&rsquo;ve got a good assortment of skills and abilities. If so, make sure you&rsquo;re playing what you want to play. There&rsquo;s no point in being the party&rsquo;s healer if that&rsquo;s not a role you&rsquo;re interested in.</p>\n</div>\n</div>"

The horde of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.不羁角色与龙套们]{龙套} chasing them can be broken up into groups as the GM decides.</p>\n<p>The rear-most character or vehicle should be at the rear&mdash;on the far left card or &ldquo;Card 1.&rdquo; Everyone else should be placed to his right as fits the circumstances. Add more cards to either end of the row if someone falls behind or surges ahead.</p>\n<p>The Range is the number of Chase Cards between participants (not counting the attacker&rsquo;s card) times the Range Increment, which varies for the type of chase:</p>\n<table class=\"table reverse-value-table\" style=\"width: 66%;\"><caption class=\"table-caption\">\n<h2 class=\"table-title\">Range Increments</h2>\n</caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"table-header-row\">\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Type</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Increment</th>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Foot, Mounted, or Vehicular</td>\n<td>5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Airplane or Sailing Ship</td>\n<td>25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jets or Starships</td>\n<td>50</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>These are <em>suggested</em> ranges based on the weapons typically used in that type of chase. The goal is to give most ranged weapons the ability to fire at a few cards distance and give an advantage to those with longer ranged weapons. Increase or decrease the Range Increment as makes sense for the particular scenario. In a tank battle, for instance, you might want to change the Range Increment to 100, even though it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;vehicular&rdquo; fight.</p>\n<img src=\"modules/swade-core-rules/assets/art/ChaseExample.webp\" alt=\"An example layout of a chase with five cards with Red and Gabe in persuit of a Ninja. Gabe is four cards away from the ninja, so he's 20 feet (40 yards) away. Red is two cards away from the ninja so she's 10 feet (20 yards) away.\" />\n<h2>Chase Rounds</h2>\n<p>Once all the participants are placed, deal each independent character or group an @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.行动卡 (先攻)]{行动卡} at the start of each round as usual. They then act in whatever order they choose as their Action Card comes up. This is important so passengers can @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.援助]{援助} their driver before he has to make a critical roll, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.考验]{考验} a foe to make him @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.分神与脆弱]{脆弱}, attack <em>before</em> their vehicle changes distance (<em>or</em> after) to take maximum advantage of their weapons, and so on.</p>\n<p>The participants can move along the track using the <strong>Change Position</strong> maneuver (see below), closing on foes, running from them, or attempting to reach some objective.</p>\n<p>The length of each round is up to the GM, but is usually a combat round in a foot or car chase. Battles in space might represent many minutes per round until the action zooms in on a fast-paced dogfight.</p>\n<p><strong>Boarders:</strong> Characters in or on an enemy vehicle get their own Action Card (as a group).</p>\n<p><strong>Minimum Speed:</strong> The Game Master must decide who&rsquo;s allowed to participate in a chase. A kid on a bike might be able to chase bandits in a car if the streets are very congested, but is left behind after a round on the open road.</p>\n<p><strong>Ending the Chase:</strong> A chase ends when one side gets away (disabling all pursuers, the Flee maneuver, etc.) or is forced to stop. Participants can always choose to stop if they want, either dropping out or stopping to engage their enemies.</p>\n<p>A chase might also end after a certain number of rounds or as one or more of those involved reach a certain card along the track. In a <cite>Weird War Two</cite> bombing run, for example, the bombers might need to reach the last card on the track to drop their payload. The fighters scrambling after them must try to stop them before they reach their target.</p>\n<h3>Chase Actions</h3>\n<p>Characters in a chase can do most anything they&rsquo;d normally do, such as @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.考验]{考验}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.援助]{援助}, use @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.奇术]{奇术}, or make @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.攻击]{攻击}. The GM decides how close a character has to be to try a particular action. A defender must be able to see or hear a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.嘲弄]{嘲弄} for it to be effective, for example. If the attacker and defender are connected via audio or video feeds, of course, distance probably won&rsquo;t matter.</p>\n<p>Nonplayer character crews of ships, starships, and other large vehicles are assumed to be doing their jobs already and shouldn&rsquo;t roll Support or Tests. Those special actions are the domain of the player characters or named Extras and @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.不羁角色与龙套们]{不羁角色}&mdash;including those on the opposing side!</p>\n<p><strong>Held Actions:</strong> A character on Hold may attempt to interrupt enemy actions as usual. In personal combat (including foot chases), the two make opposed @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.运动]{运动} rolls. When mounted, it&rsquo;s opposed @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.骑乘]{骑乘} rolls. In vehicle chases, the GM must decide which skills are most appropriate (@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.运动]{运动} vs. maneuvering to interrupt the driver, for example).</p>\n<p>If trying to act before an entire vehicle, ship, or group with multiple characters takes its action, the opposed roll should be made against the driver or leader.</p>\n<aside class=\"graph_quarter\">\n<h2>Groups</h2>\n<p>Make Group rolls for @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.不羁角色与龙套们]{龙套} who move and act together. If they have a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.不羁角色与龙套们]{不羁角色} leader, use his skill to make maneuvering rolls and assume his leadership keeps the group together.</p>\n<p>This means @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.伤害效果]{动摇} members of a group are dragged along with the rest, and individual @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.伤害效果]{损伤} or other conditions are ignored unless that specific member is targeted, or all the members of the group share the same condition.</p>\n</aside>\n<h3>Maneuvers</h3>\n<p>Below are a number of special maneuvers characters can attempt during a chase. Maneuvers may also be part of a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.复合动作]{Multi-Action}. A driver can Change Position and fire his weapon, for example, or say he attempts a Force if he gets close enough.</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Board (Action): </strong>Sailing ships use grappling hooks and planks to pull their prey close and board. Starships might use breaching tubes or assault pods.<br />To board, the attacker and defender must be on the same Chase Card. The two then make opposed maneuvering rolls. If the attacker is successful, the two vessels are joined and his crew may board the enemy craft.<br />If defenders have been designated to repel boarders and weren&rsquo;t being used for other purposes (such as sailing or crewing stations on a starship), they start on @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.待机]{待机} unless the attacker won the boarding roll with a raise.<br />Once a boarding action begins, the com&shy;mander of the boarded vessel can only attempt to Change Position, which is made at &minus;4 if grappling lines, tractor beams, or other restraints are involved. If she&rsquo;s successful, her vessel is no longer grappled (though some of the boarders may still be on her ship!). With a raise, she breaks free and may move one Chase Card in either direction.</li>\n<li><strong>Change Position (Action or Free Action):</strong> A character or driver may change his position by making a maneuvering roll as a free action. Success allows him to move up or down one Chase Card, and up to two with a raise. The character may also Change Position as an action, adding +2 to his roll. Either way, this maneuver may only be used once per turn.<br /><strong>Speed Bonus:</strong> If a rider, runner, ship, or vehicle&rsquo;s Top Speed is faster than the fastest of his rivals, he adds +1 to his maneuvering roll to Change Position, or +2 if he&rsquo;s twice as fast.<br /><strong>Dropping Back:</strong> In a linear chase, a character may drop &ldquo;back&rdquo; one or two Chase Cards without making a maneuvering roll. He may not Change Position further, either as an action or a free action.</li>\n<li><strong>Evade (Action or Free Action):</strong> The char&shy;acter or driver zigzags through terrain, maximizes cover, or otherwise concentrates on not getting hit. Melee and ranged attacks against him, his vehicle, or anyone on it suffer a &minus;2 penalty until the start of that vehicle&rsquo;s next turn. The character and any occupants on his mount or in his vehicle also take the penalty to their attacks as the erratic movement or obstacles affect their targeting and aim as well. If the character performs this maneuver as an action, the penalty increases to &minus;4 (in both directions).<br />Evade may not be taken more than once per round (it does not stack).</li>\n<li><strong>Flee (Action):</strong> A character or vehicle may escape the chase if there are at least four Chase Cards between himself and the closest foe. If so, he makes a maneuvering roll at &minus;4 and escapes if successful. The penalty is reduced to &minus;2 if there are at least five cards between them, and 0 if there are six or more.</li>\n<li><strong>Force (Action):</strong> The attacker attempts to force a rival away from his vehicle or into an obstacle. To do so, both must be on the same Chase Card and make opposed maneuvering rolls. If the attacker wins, he <strong>Bumps</strong> (see below) his foe. A raise is treated as if the defender rolled a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性投骰]{大失败} on a maneuvering roll (see <strong>Maneuvering Skills</strong>, above).<br />The GM may also allow characters to use other skills, such as @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.射击]{射击}, to put obstacles in the foe&rsquo;s path. Critical Failure means the attempt backfires on the attacker!</li>\n<li><strong>Hold Steady (Free Action):</strong> The character, driver, or pilot holds steady to line up a better shot. They ignore the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.不稳平台]{不稳平台} and @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.移动]{奔跑} penalties, but attacks against the vehicle and all its occupants are made at +2 until the beginning of their next turn (this does not stack with Vulnerable).</li>\n<li><strong>Ram (Action):</strong> An attacker can Ram a defender if they&rsquo;re on the same Chase Card by making opposed maneuvering rolls. If successful, both participants cause the following damage to the other: <br />\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Scale:</strong> The base damage each being or vehicle causes is based on its Scale: Small (d6), Normal (2d6), Large (3d6), Huge (4d6), and Gargantuan (5d6).</li>\n<li><strong>Raise:</strong> +d6 bonus damage for the attacker if he got a raise on his maneuvering roll. Toughness: +d6 if the vehicle&rsquo;s Tough&shy;ness is higher than his foe&rsquo;s; +2d6 if Toughness is twice as high.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.速度]{速度}:</strong> +d6 to both sides if the attacker&rsquo;s Top Speed is between 60 and 120 MPH; +2d6 if it&rsquo;s over 120 MPH.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<aside class=\"bump-aside\">\n<h2>Bump</h2>\n<p>Several circumstances result in a character or group being &ldquo;Bumped.&rdquo; The foe who caused the Bump may move the defender one Chase Card in any direction. She may do this at any time during her turn as she chooses (to resolve other attacks first, for example).</p>\n<p>When a target is Bumped by an indirect action (such as a Complication), the opposing side chooses the direction.</p>\n<p>An attacker can&rsquo;t Bump a particular target more than one space each turn regardless of the source (multiple attacks, the Force maneuver, etc.). Other attackers, even those sharing the same @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.行动卡 (先攻)]{行动卡}, may Bump the target separately, however.</p>\n<p>Groups always stay together in a chase, so they&rsquo;re only moved if their driver or leader is Bumped, or the GM feels it&rsquo;s narratively appropriate.</p>\n<p>Bumps are only used in chases. Ignore them on the tabletop.</p>\n</aside>\n<h3>Complications</h3>\n<p>If a character or group&rsquo;s @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.行动卡 (先攻)]{行动卡} is a Club, something has gone wrong. An obstacle may block the path, the engine might stall, or a hero might have to run through mud, ice, uphill, or some other impediment.</p>\n<p>The character, driver, or pilot must make a maneuvering roll as a free action to deal with the Complication. The suit on his current Chase Card determines any modifier to the maneuvering roll and the results of failure.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <em>Action Card</em> triggers the Comp&shy;lication; the <em>Chase Card</em> defines any modifier (Mod) and the result of failure.</p>\n<table class=\"table\"><caption class=\"table-caption\">\n<h2 class=\"table-title\">Complications</h2>\n</caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"table-header-row\">\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Suit</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Mod</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Failure Result</th>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Spades</strong></td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>Treat as a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性投骰]{大失败} on a maneuver&shy;ing roll.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Hearts</strong></td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>The character or vehicle is Bumped.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Diamonds</strong></td>\n<td>-2</td>\n<td>The character or vehicle is Bumped.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Clubs</strong></td>\n<td>-2</td>\n<td>Treat as a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性投骰]{大失败} on a maneuver&shy;ing roll.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Joker</strong></td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>The character or vehicle is Bumped up to two Chase Cards.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Special Conditions:</strong> GMs can also use Complications to trigger special conditions or hazards of the encounter. For example, trig&shy;gering reinforcements anytime a Diamond Complication occurs, or the first character to fail a Club Complication is hit by lightning during a battle in a fierce storm.</p>\n<h2>Attacks</h2>\n<p>Characters may make ranged and melee attacks normally, using all their usual @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.专长]{专长} and @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.负赘]{负赘} as usual as long as the GM agrees they make sense in the particular situation.</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Melee Attacks:</strong> In foot, mounted, or car chases, characters can make hand-to-hand attacks only if they&rsquo;re on the same Chase Card. The usual rules, such as the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.围攻]{Gang-Up} bonus, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.撤出近战]{撤出近战}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.无辜旁人]{无辜旁人}, etc., apply as the GM sees fit.<br />Should anyone want to attack a moving vehicle, its @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.角色]{格挡} is 2+ half the driver&rsquo;s maneuvering skill, plus its @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.载具注释]{操控性}. Attacks aren&rsquo;t usually possible between very fast vehicles, airplanes, starships, and the like.</li>\n<li><strong>Ranged Attacks:</strong> Drivers and chara&shy;cters can fire ranged weapons as usual. The @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.射程]{射程} is the number of Chase Cards between participants (not counting the attacker&rsquo;s card) times the Range Increment. Attacks may also target crew if they&rsquo;re visible (don&rsquo;t forget any @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.掩蔽与障碍]{掩蔽} they might have).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Damage</h3>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Characters/Mounts:</strong> Damage is resolved normally, but if the character (or his mount) is @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.伤害效果]{动摇}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.震慑]{震慑}, or @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.伤害效果]{损伤} in a chase, he&rsquo;s Bumped as well.</li>\n<li><strong>Vehicles:</strong> Vehicles cannot be Shaken, but if damage equals or exceeds their Toughness (whether they take a Wound or not), the driver must make a maneuvering roll or go <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-tables.失控]{失控}</strong>.<br />Each raise on a vehicular damage roll causes a Wound and one roll on the <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-tables.载具重创]{载具重创}</strong> table (not one roll per Wound). Most vehicles can take three Wounds before they&rsquo;re <strong>Wrecked</strong> (see below). Each Wound reduces a vehicle&rsquo;s Handling by 1 (to a maximum of &minus;4).<br />If this is a chase, damage that equals or exceeds a vehicle&rsquo;s Toughness also <strong>Bumps</strong> it (see above), but only once per attacker.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Called Shots on Vehicles:</strong> To target a par&shy;ticular part of a vehicle, the GM assigns a modifier based on the dimensions of the target. See <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.体型和尺寸]{Size &amp; Scale}</strong> and <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.掩蔽与障碍]{掩蔽}</strong> for specifics. If the attack is successful and causes a Wound, it also causes the effects for that area (see the <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-tables.载具重创]{载具重创}</strong> table).</p>\n<aside class=\"vehicle-attacks\">\n<h3>Fixed Weapons</h3>\n<p>Front-mounted weapons may only fire at targets ahead of them, side weapons to their respective sides, and rear weapons behind. Top or bottom mounted turreted weapons may fire in any direction unless the situation or particular vehicle says otherwise (assume ships, planes, or starships rise and fall during the turn to accommodate their top or bottom weapons).</p>\n<p><strong>Fixed Side-Mounted Weapons (Cannons):</strong> Firing fixed side-mounted weapons&mdash;those that must be aimed by turning the entire vessel&mdash;must be positioned. The captain or pilot chooses his target and makes an opposed maneuvering roll as an action. Failure means he can&rsquo;t line up a shot this turn. Success means the attacker may fire up to half his guns on one side at the target, and a raise means he may fire all of them at that target (a &ldquo;broadside&rdquo;).</p>\n<p>Treat each set of up to four cannons as @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.载具注释]{\"linked\"}, rolling attacks and damage separately for each set.</p>\n<p><strong>Crossing the T:</strong> If a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.体型和尺寸]{大型} target (or greater) is hit by a broadside at @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.射程]{近距}, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;raked&rdquo; along its length. Add an additional d6 to each damage roll resulting from the rake.</p>\n<h3>Reaction Fire</h3>\n<p>Weapons with this quality spray massive amounts of matter or energy, making them quick to fire against enemies who dart in and out of range to attack. Once per round when their craft is attacked, Reaction Fire weapons may return fire at &minus;2. The attack is resolved <em>after</em> the enemy&rsquo;s who triggered it (if the gunner survives).</p>\n</aside>\n<h3>Wrecked</h3>\n<p>Vehicles take three @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.伤害效果]{损伤} before they&rsquo;re &ldquo;Wrecked&rdquo; as their base. @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.体型和尺寸]{大型} vehicles can take four Wounds, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.体型和尺寸]{超大型} can take five, and @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.体型和尺寸]{巨型} can take six.</p>\n<p>A wrecked land vehicle can&rsquo;t move, but its weapons may still be fired if they aren&rsquo;t powered by the vehicle&rsquo;s propulsion system.</p>\n<p>Watercraft sink. Small vessels sink in a few rounds. Medium boats might take up to an hour to slip beneath the surface, and large ships might take several hours.</p>\n<p>Aircraft plummet to the ground and are destroyed.</p>\n<p><strong>Occupants:</strong> Those inside a vehicle (and whatever it hits, if it matters) take damage depending on what caused the Wreck:</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Collisions:</strong> If the vehicle is Wrecked from a Collision on the <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-tables.失控]{失控}</strong> table, the passengers suffer Xd6 damage, where X is equal to the Wounds the vehicle suffered from the collision (don&rsquo;t forget any <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.载具注释]{Air Bags &amp; Safety Harnesses}</strong>).</li>\n<li>Damage: If the vehicle is Wrecked from Wounds caused by enemy attacks, occu&shy;pants in a land vehicle, speed boat, starship, or similar vessel take 3d6 damage, or 5d6 if the GM feels the vehicle was traveling at a high speed (usually in excess of 60 MPH) or some other precarious circumstance. Those on large boats or ships don&rsquo;t take Wounds but must contend with Swimming rolls and survival afterward.<br />Occupants of an aircraft make an @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.运动]{运动} roll if they have parachutes to land safely. Failure means they take <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.冲撞s and Bruises]{Bumps &amp; Bruises}</strong>, from a hard landing. Those who roll a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性投骰]{大失败} on @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.运动]{运动} or are without parachutes plummet to their death, unless the GM feels they have a chance to survive. In that case they suffer <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.坠落]{坠落}</strong> damage instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Repairs</h3>\n<p>Characters may repair vehicles given sufficient time and at least some basic tools. The attempt takes two hours per Wound and a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.修理]{修理} roll. If the roll fails, the mechanic must start over.</p>\n<p>Field work requires at least a toolbox and basic supplies, and subtracts 2 from the Repair roll. An average garage negates this penalty, and an excellent or dedicated facility adds +2.</p>\n<p>Each success and raise on the Repair roll fixes one of the vehicle&rsquo;s Wounds. With an additional raise above and beyond what&rsquo;s required to fix all Wounds, the repair time is halved.</p>\n<p><strong>Wrecks: </strong>Wrecked vehicles can be repaired if the mechanic has access to a full body shop and spare parts (GM&rsquo;s call). This takes a full day before other repairs can be made.</p>\n<img src=\"modules/swade-core-rules/assets/art/Driveby.webp\" alt=\"Image of Gabe firing a submachine gun out of a window of a car, while Red is driving, persued by two motorcycles.\" />\n<h2>Customized Chases</h2>\n<p>A little customization can make each chase different and unique. Here are some ideas you can use for your encounters.</p>\n<h3>City Streets</h3>\n<p>Busy streets are a dangerous place for high-speed vehicle or frantic foot chases. Ranged attacks are made at &minus;2 (in addition to @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.射程]{射程} penalties) to account for the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.掩蔽与障碍]{掩蔽} of buildings, cars, pedestrians, and so on.</p>\n<p>Complications besides Jokers have a mini&shy;mum penalty of &minus;2 to represent the dangers of running red lights, pedestrians that must be avoided, blocked streets, or other hazards.</p>\n<p><strong>Rooftops:</strong> If the chase takes place on rooftops, change the results for @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性投骰]{大失败} (and failed Complications that say to treat the result as a Critical Failure) to the following:</p>\n<p>Roll a d6. On a 1&ndash;2, the runner loses his turn. On a 3&ndash;4, he takes Fatigue. On a 5&ndash;6, he tumbles over an edge and must make an immediate @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.运动]{运动} roll (a free action). Success means he catches a ledge, railing, gutter, or other precipice and can pull himself up with a Strength roll (a free action each round). Failure means he&rsquo;s stuck for the turn and can take no further actions. A Critical Failure means the hero falls d6 &times; 10 stories&mdash;or whatever the GM feels is appropriate for that city.</p>\n<h3>Deep Space</h3>\n<p>The <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.不稳平台]{不稳平台}</strong> penalty usually applies in chases, but it can be ignored in the vacuum of deep space!</p>\n<h3>Dogfights &amp; Duels</h3>\n<p>The Chase rules generally assume the combatants are moving in the same direction&mdash;chasing prey, toward a target or escape route, etc. But the rules can also easily accommodate dogfights, tank battles, demolition derbies, and aerial or naval duels by arranging the Chase Cards in different ways.</p>\n<p>Instead of dealing the Chase Cards in a straight line, arrange them in a 4&thinsp;&times;&thinsp;4 grid to create a more fluid battlefield. Vehicles move and count Range orthogonally (no diagonals). Use common sense when determining weapon arcs and vehicle facings. A pirate ship with cannons on either side, for example, can fire left and right on an action, but can&rsquo;t fire at targets ahead or behind them on the same action.</p>\n<p>Change the Range Increment as makes sense for your particular battle, letting the weapons with the longest ranges reach across the board but forcing those with shorter range to get in close.</p>\n<p>You can also place special cards in the grid to represent asteroid fields or space stations in space battles, whirlpools and islands in naval battles, and so on. They might be impassable or have their own special rules as you see fit.</p>\n<h3>Naval Chases</h3>\n<p>Bringing a target to battle on the high seas can take many hours or even days depending on the weather and the initial distance between the vessels.</p>\n<p>If the ships are more than a mile apart when first encountered, assume the first phase of the chase represents the pursuer trying to bring the prey to battle. Treat each round as about four hours (or much longer in the age of sail if the wind is against them) and the Range Increment as a <em>mile</em>.</p>\n<p>Once the pursuer reaches the same Chase Card as the prey, &ldquo;zoom&rdquo; in on the action and run the chase as usual, perhaps using the <strong>Dogfights and Duels</strong> option discussed above.</p>\n<div style=\"display: block; margin: auto; width: 50%;\"><img src=\"modules/swade-core-rules/assets/art/pg120_quote_yar.webp\" alt=\"YAR! &mdash; Red\" /></div>\n<aside class=\"graph_quarter\">\n<h2>Vehicles on the Tabletop</h2>\n<p>For car or boat chases and aerial or space duels with a lot of movement and mobility, use the Chase system. In tabletop battles where vehicles must operate in a confined space (and you want to use miniatures!), use these simple rules to handle the movement of most common land vehicles.</p>\n<h3>Movement</h3>\n<p>Vehicles can move up to 12&Prime; on the tabletop (or their @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.移动]{移速} if slower than that) without having to make maneuvering rolls or worry about crashing into obstacles. At that speed they can move as desired and end their turn facing any direction.</p>\n<p>If a driver wants to go faster, up to 24&Prime; per turn unless the GM says otherwise given the terrain and situation, he can do so but must make a maneuvering roll. The GM should assign a penalty (&minus;1 to &minus;4) if the move takes the vehicle through @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.移动]{困难地形}, tight turns, or hazards. If the roll is successful, the vehicle ends its move wherever the driver wants. Failure means the vehicle moves only 12&Prime;.</p>\n<p>A Critical Failure means the vehicle goes @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-tables.失控]{失控}. If that indicates a collision, the GM can move it into the nearest obstacle or decide it&rsquo;s a feature not modeled on the tabletop such as a pothole, small ditch, fallen log, battlefield debris, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Ramming is an opposed test of maneuvering skills.

She makes a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.航空]{航空} roll as a free action and gets a 7, +2 for her ship&rsquo;s Handling gives her a 9. That&rsquo;s a success and a raise so she moves two Chase Cards closer.</p>\n<p>There are now two Chase Cards between Red and her target, or 100&Prime;. That&rsquo;s Medium Range for her Gatling so she fires it up.</p>\n<p>The base TN is 4, &minus;2 for Medium Range (no penalty for Unstable Platform in space!). The Rate of Fire on the Gatling is 4 though, so Red rolls four d10s (her Shooting skill) and a Wild die. She gets one regular hit and one with a raise. The regular hit causes 16 damage, which is 2 over the pirate&rsquo;s Toughness of 14. The pirate must make a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.航空]{航空} roll (he makes it) or go Out of Control. Since this is a Chase, Red also Bumps him a card <em>away</em>&mdash;a smart move since the pirate goes next.</p>\n<p>Now Red resolves the hit with a raise. This one causes a Wound. She can&rsquo;t Bump the pirate again in her same turn, but he still has to make another @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.航空]{航空} roll or go @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-tables.失控]{失控}. He fails this time and rolls a 3 on the table, which gives him another Wound. Since he took Wounds from the attack, he takes a Critical Hit as well. It&rsquo;s a 5, so his Top Speed drops 10%. He&rsquo;s now slower than Red so she adds +1 to her @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.航空]{航空} rolls when changing positions.</p>\n<!-- Choice was made to remove trade dress for the following two sections -->\n<h2>Crews</h2>\n<p>Passengers and crews go in whatever order they decide on their @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.行动卡 (先攻)]{行动卡}. This can make for dramatic and interactive experiences with a little narrative interpretation. On a pirate ship, the captain makes the maneuvering (@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.驾船]{驾船}) rolls. The rest of the player characters fire a cannon, take a shot with a musket (if the captain is willing to get that close!), yell insults at the enemy (@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.考验]{考验}), or point out hazards (@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.援助]{援助} for the captain&rsquo;s @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.驾船]{驾船} rolls).</p>\n<p>The player character-controlled &ldquo;bridge crew&rdquo; of a starship can do the same. Maybe the captain focuses on Testing the enemy in a duel of wits and leaves the maneuvering rolls to the Navigation officer. The Weapons officers fire weapons while the Engineer Supports the navigator, captain, or gunners as needed each turn.</p>\n<h2>Reminders</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add or subtract Chase Cards to the track as needed.</li>\n<li>A character&rsquo;s <em>Action Card</em> determines if a Complication occurs, but his <em>Chase Card</em> determines any penalty and results of failure.</li>\n<li>Dealing with a Complication is a free action.</li>\n<li>Evade and Hold Steady are good options for characters who don&rsquo;t expect frequent chases and so don&rsquo;t have Edges like @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-edges.手稳]{手稳}.</li>\n</ul>\n<img src=\"modules/swade-core-rules/assets/art/space-battle.webp\" alt=\"An image of a space battle with a smaller ship firing at a much bigger capital class spaceship.\" /></div>\n</div>"

Once Conviction lapses, however, the effect ends.</p>\n<h3>Triumph And Tragedy</h3>\n<p>Conviction is granted for personal triumph and tragedy, drawing on a character&rsquo;s entire background, including&mdash;but not limited to&mdash;his @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.专长]{专长} and @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.负赘]{负赘}.</p>\n<p>Savage settings may also grant Conviction for certain world-specific actions or events.</p>\n<p><strong>Triumph:</strong> Characters gain Conviction when they overcome significant obstacles core to their overall goals and motivations. This might mean defeating powerful enemies, saving a true love, or overcoming some great mystery or problem.</p>\n<p>The victory should be an achievement over and above the usual. A vampire hunter in <cite>Rippers</cite> shouldn&rsquo;t get Conviction every time he kills a vampire, for example, but he might when he wipes out an entire coven or slays a powerful master vamp&shy;ire. A super hero might gain Conviction when she saves her true love from a death trap or the clutches of a powerful villain. She wouldn&rsquo;t earn it just because her boyfriend is in a dangerous encounter.</p>\n<p><strong>Tragedy:</strong> Some of the most interesting heroes of fiction, film, and legend spend as much time battling their personal demons as they do fighting their foes. Eventually these same issues give them strength as they work through their grief or overcome obstacles to rise once more against the challenges they face.</p>\n<p>When a character experiences a significant personal loss or destructive event, and the GM feels it&rsquo;s appropriate, he gains Conviction. The death of a loved one or close friend (including a party member he was close to), losing an important job, giving in to harmful character flaws and vices, being removed from a case or quest, or getting framed for a crime are all classic examples of heroic tragedy.</p>\n<p>These might happen in the course of the game, but players should also proactively suggest their own ideas to the Game Master. Consider your hero&rsquo;s backstory and occasionally look for ways to do what your favorite authors do to their characters&mdash;torture them! Think about what&rsquo;s important to them and threaten it or take it away. Most of the time this should be done as a quick narrative tale or a scene with a little interaction and roleplaying so as not to distract from the main campaign or the other players&rsquo; time, but occasionally it might inspire a side-trek or adventure to regain&mdash;or avenge!&mdash;whatever was lost.</p>\n<p>Note that earning Conviction for harmful behavior is motivation for players in a game to occasionally spotlight their character&rsquo;s dark side. It is not an endorsement or rationalization of poor conduct in the real world.</p>\n<h2 class=\"blue-example\">Example: Red's Rage</h2>\n<p>Emily is Red, a fighter in a fantasy campaign. She has &ldquo;anger management issues&rdquo; but didn&rsquo;t take the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-hindrances.自私]{自私} Hindrance because she&rsquo;s had her problem under control for a year or so. But it&rsquo;s a fun part of her backstory and Emily loves roleplaying constantly managing her character&rsquo;s temper.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Red and her constant ally Gabe failed in their last adventure. Emily decides this is a good time for Red to go on a rampage. She narrates a story about going into town and terrorizing everyone in sight with her surly attitude. During the course of a &ldquo;bad day,&rdquo; she breaks a window, turns over an apple cart, and even insults a friar&rsquo;s mule!</p>\n<p>The GM loves Emily&rsquo;s story and awards her a point of Conviction. In the game, Red is barred from the local tavern, has to pay for all the damage she caused, and is refused help by the friar (the town&rsquo;s only healer!) until she performs some act of penance (a new quest!)</p>\n<p>More importantly, Emily told a story about her heroine&rsquo;s tragic flaw&mdash;and has a point of Conviction to carry her through the next chapter of her quest.</p>\n</div>"

Here are some guidelines.</p>\n<p>Assume each player will average one success per turn. Use that as a guideline if you want the task to be &ldquo;fair,&rdquo; and set the number of rounds from three to five as you feel appropriate. A party of five given three rounds to save a starship, for example, needs to accumulate 15 Task Tokens in three rounds. Increase or decrease the number of tokens to make it more or less challenging.</p>\n<p>If the number of tokens achieved is a measure of success rather than a straight win/fail condition, such as rescuing victims from a fire or taking bags of gold from a bank before the automated vault closes, simply set the possible number of tokens that may be gathered in the time allowed. Each token gathered represents a person saved, a bag recovered, etc. It&rsquo;s up to you whether it&rsquo;s possible to save them all (using the guide above) or not.</p>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to let the party choose how many will attempt the task either, especially if there&rsquo;s something else going on at the same time. Deciding how many heroes will hack a large computer system while they&rsquo;re being attacked by security drones allows them to choose their tactics.</p>\n<h2>Performing The Task</h2>\n<p>Characters are dealt @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.行动卡 (先攻)]{行动卡} as usual during a Dramatic Task. Those attempting the task make relevant @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性]{技能} checks and get a Task Token for each success and raise. Failure means no progress and a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性投骰]{大失败} reduces progress by one (if there are any).</p>\n<p>The skills that can be used to accumulate tokens depends on the situation. They might be defined, such as @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.修理]{修理} to defuse a bomb, or they might be open&mdash;a police officer might use @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.运动]{运动} to carry people from a burning building while a mage uses telekinesis (@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.施法]{施法}).</p>\n<h3>Multiple Skills</h3>\n<p>The GM can break tasks down into steps if she likes, each of which might require different skills. In defusing a bomb, for example, the heroes might first have to get two tokens to crack open the casing using @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.修理]{修理}, then three more tokens using @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.电子学]{电子学} to rewire the timer.</p>\n<p>Requiring multiple skills throughout the task makes it more difficult since raises from one type of skill check don&rsquo;t carry over to the other. In the bomb example above, for example, cracking open the case requires two Repair successes. Additional successes don&rsquo;t carry over to the Electronics rolls needed afterward.</p>\n<h3>Complications</h3>\n<p>If a character&rsquo;s @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.行动卡 (先攻)]{行动卡} is a Club, some&shy;thing has gone wrong. Attempts to resolve the task (or @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.援助]{援助} it!) are made at an additional &minus;2.</p>\n<p>Worse, if a roll is failed during a Compl&shy;ication, the Dramatic Task fails&mdash;the bomb explodes, the computer locks the hacker out, a victim cannot be saved, and so on. The character may choose not to attempt a roll on a turn he has a Complication&mdash;it just costs him precious time.</p>\n<p><strong>Support: </strong>Characters assisting with the Support option suffer the Complication penalty, and an additional &minus;2 if their Action Card is a Club! @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性投骰]{大失败} on their part just subtracts from the lead&rsquo;s roll as usual, however, it doesn&rsquo;t cause the entire task to fail.</p>\n<h3>Death Traps</h3>\n<p>Think carefully before designing Dramatic Tasks that might wipe out the entire party if failed. The threat of catastrophe should be very real&mdash;<em>Savage Worlds</em> is designed around that very concept&mdash;but you don&rsquo;t want a couple of bad die rolls to end the entire game.</p>\n<p>Instead of total disaster, maybe the party has a moment to run before the bomb explodes. They don&rsquo;t perish, but later awake in the local hospital, or even captured and experience a new type of adventure.</p>\n<img src=\"modules/swade-core-rules/assets/art/bomb-defusal.webp\" alt=\"Image of Gabe defusing a bomb while Red gaurds him, firing her pistol at out-of-frame attackers.\" />\n<h2 class=\"blue-example\">Example: The Fire Bug</h2>\n<p>Gabe and Red are cops in New York City searching for an arsonist who&rsquo;s been setting fire bombs all over the city. The &ldquo;Fire Bug&rdquo; placed the latest bomb in a gang warehouse in hopes of starting a war with their rivals.</p>\n<p>Red and Gabe found the device and are trying to defuse it while the gangers attack the cops for being on their turf!</p>\n<p>The GM decides only one character can defuse the bomb, and that it&rsquo;s a Challenging task (four Task Tokens in three rounds). The GM also decides each step is a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.修理]{修理} roll at &minus;2 for the difficulty of Fire Bug&rsquo;s devices. Gabe starts working on the bomb right away while Red keeps the gang members away.</p>\n<p>Gabe gets a success and a raise on his first round thanks to @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.援助]{援助} from Red (who also uses @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Suppresive Fire]{Suppresive Fire} as a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.复合动作]{Multi-Action} to keep the gang members away). He&rsquo;s halfway there!</p>\n<p>A Complication comes up on the second round. Gabe is low on @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.助力点]{助力点} so he decides to wait and Supports Red&rsquo;s Suppressive Fire instead.</p>\n<p>On the third and final round Gabe fails&hellip;the heroes have to run for it! KaBoOM! They failed to defuse the bomb and now the gang war is on&mdash;but this just leads to new adventures for our heroes!</p>\n<img src=\"modules/swade-core-rules/assets/art/pg123_quote_firebug.webp\" alt=\"You can't win 'em all. &mdash; Gabe'\" /></div>\n</div>"

The failure still happens in some way, but the character can spend one Benny (and only one) for one more roll.

Or a warrior who fumbles a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.格斗]{格斗} roll might hit a foe as if he&rsquo;d thrown the weapon!</p>\n<p>The player and Game Master should work together to describe the scene in some fun or bizarre way that explains how the mishap ultimately results in success.</p>\n<p class=\"embedded-example\"><strong>Example: </strong>Red fires three shots from her submachine gun (Rate of Fire 3). She rolls a 1 on her Wild Die and two of her Shooting dice&mdash;a Critical Failure! The GM decides the sudden recoil makes her drop her gun.<br />Red&rsquo;s player, Emily, calls on Dumb Luck and spends a Benny. The reroll results in two hits (one with a raise!).

Terrible monsters and bitter rivals oppose them. The elements are against them. Mysteries must be solved, artifacts found, innocents saved.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s your privilege as Game Master to bring all these fantastic elements to life, challenging your players with adventure beyond their wildest imaginations and providing a framework to find out if they succeed or fail in their ultimate goal.</p>\n<p>This is the fun of being a Game Master&mdash;creating, managing, and presenting an entire world of excitement and adventure to your friends and peers. It can be one of the most satisfying entertainment experiences in existence and <cite>Savage Worlds</cite> is designed to help you ruthlessly wring every tension-filled moment and gut-busting laugh from it.</p>\n<p>So now you&rsquo;ve read the rules and probably have more ideas for a new campaign than you know what to do with, but before you dive in, let&rsquo;s take a moment to talk about the art of being a good Game Master, leading your group, creating worlds, and putting together memorable and exciting adventures.</p>\n<h3>Learning The Rules</h3>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t be intimidated by all the rules in <cite>Savage Worlds</cite>. They&rsquo;re meant to handle most everything under the sun, but all you need to start is how to resolve @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性投骰]{Trait Rolls} and basic @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.战斗]{战斗}.</p>\n<p>Everything else in this book, from all those @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.追逐与载具]{追逐} maneuvers to @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.幕间]{幕间} and @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Rules]{情景规则} can be ignored until you need them.</p>\n<p>A great way to learn the core rules is to run a simple fight on your own first. Put a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.不羁角色与龙套们]{不羁角色} fighter and three skeletons on the table in front of you and have at it. Your only goal is to get a feel for rolling the dice, figuring totals from @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性投骰]{绝佳} and modifiers, rolling and @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.造成伤害]{applying damage}, and @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.化解投骰]{化解} @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.伤害效果]{损伤}.</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve got the hang of that, you&rsquo;re ready to run your first game. Don&rsquo;t worry if you and your friends have to look a few things up the first time. And don&rsquo;t be afraid not to look things up and just wing it if you&rsquo;re in the middle of a good story and want to move on. The vast majority of the experience is just you and your friends talking and making some skill rolls. All those extra rules are there when you want or need them to help make a decision.</p>\n<h3>Your Game</h3>\n<p>You might think the first step in starting a new game is finding a group of people to play with. That is important, but don&rsquo;t do that yet. First get <em>yourself</em> excited. Figure out what you want to run and start jotting down ideas. Do that and you&rsquo;ll likely get all your friends excited as well.</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve figured out what kind of setting you want to run, ask yourself what types of characters your friends might play. What might a typical adventure be like? Write down what makes your game cool, who the bad guys are, what kinds of magic or other supernatural aspects are present, and what your basic storyline is. If you have these elements, you likely have enough information to get your friends excited and ready to play.</p>\n<h3>Game Nights</h3>\n<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to recruit some players. You have a great campaign idea and enough information about it to explain it to your friends. The next step is to find out who wants to play and when they can get together.</p>\n<p>It might be best to tell everyone when <em>you&rsquo;d</em> like to run your game. You&rsquo;re the one person who must be there every session so the timing needs to work for you. You can alter it based on your friends&rsquo; schedules, of course, but if you just ask when everyone is free you&rsquo;re going to spend a lot of time trying to manage a lot of often vague or conflicting preferences.</p>\n<p>Most groups meet once a week, or every other week, depending on how busy everyone is. More important is that once you set a regular date you try and stick to it. If you rely on a fluctuating schedule people tend to forget or schedule conflicting events. People have busy lives, and as much as everyone involved might want to play, they still have to study for classes, take care of their children, work, manage personal events, and otherwise live their lives. If you have a set night every week, it&rsquo;s much easier for your friends to schedule most of their activities around it. It also helps you know when you have to be ready to run.</p>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t rule out playing on weeknights. Friday and Saturday are great if you&rsquo;re single or in college but difficult for players who need to focus the weekends on their families. If you start at 6 p.m., your players have time to get off work, grab some food (or share the traditional pizza with the group!), and get deep into the game by 7 or so.</p>\n<p>Most sessions should wrap things up by 11 p.m. or so. Most people tend to get a little tired by then and you don&rsquo;t want game night to be a stressful experience. Talk it over with your friends and see what works for them. Setting some basic rules helps everyone schedule their time and show up week after week.</p>\n<p>You might want to end each game session with a cliffhanger, question, or quest. Hearing your players talk about what&rsquo;s going to happen next is one of the best rewards you can hope for when running a game!</p>\n<h3>Character Types</h3>\n<p>Once you have a game night and a few friends set to attend, give them some basic information on the setting and find out what kind of characters they want to play.</p>\n<p>You don&rsquo;t need everyone to make characters at this point&mdash;character creation in <cite>Savage Worlds</cite> is fast enough they can do it at your first session if you want. But if some of your friends have neat ideas as to their background or basic type (fighter, investigator, etc.), you can start doing more detail work on your story.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re going to run <cite>Deadlands</cite>, for example, and all your friends make combat types you know they&rsquo;re looking for a high-action game. You can still mix in lots of other elements&mdash;exploration, investigation, horror, deep roleplaying&mdash;but every now and then set up a big bloody shootout as well.</p>\n<img src=\"modules/swade-core-rules/assets/art/kids-on-bikes.webp\" alt=\"Image of kids three kids riding away from a a very large Cthullu esque monster. The kid in the back crashed is is on the ground while his friends ride away.\" />\n<h2>Getting the Party Together</h2>\n<p>Now that you have the <em>players</em> together, you have to figure out why their <em>characters</em> are together. There are two common ways to handle this.</p>\n<h3>The Mission</h3>\n<p>One way to build a party is for a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.不羁角色与龙套们]{nonplayer character} to offer a reward for adventurers to complete some task. Perhaps they answer a want ad, are hired in a smoky tavern, or are called on by connections or friends. Thrown together by fate and circumstance, the heroes must then learn to work as a team.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a problem that sometimes arises from this approach. Say you&rsquo;re running a fantasy campaign and the mission is to deliver a message to a distant city. But one of the characters in your group is a witch hunter. His player is all excited about making such a unique character, but you need him (and the others) to be a courier for now and accept the assignment to kick off your campaign.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, there&rsquo;s an easy fix: let the <em>player</em> figure it out. Be honest and tell him this is what you need to get things started. Maybe the witch hunter is simply between jobs. Or maybe he&rsquo;s working under cover to root out some evil sorceress, or needs to earn gold to buy better arms and equipment for his true quest. Or maybe the employer or the recipient is an old friend (or enemy).</p>\n<p>This approach not only helps get things moving but empowers the player and might give your campaign a new and interesting subplot!</p>\n<h3>Former Acquaintances</h3>\n<p>You can also start a campaign with all the characters already knowing each other. This works great for getting the game moving, and is very appropriate for certain campaign types. In <em>Weird Wars</em> settings, for example, the player characters have often served together for weeks, months, or even years. They know the basic faults and vices of their companions. This is also a great way to kick off a convention game where your group only has a few hours to play.</p>\n<h3>Staying Together</h3>\n<p>After the first adventure, the players may wonder why their characters stay together. That&rsquo;s easy if they&rsquo;re employed by a common benefactor, or if similar groups are common to the setting (adventuring crews, military teams, and so on).</p>\n<p>Staying together might be more difficult if the campaign goal isn&rsquo;t very clear though, or if some of the characters don&rsquo;t get along that well. How to fix this depends a lot on the type of game you&rsquo;re running. If there&rsquo;s a clear, overall objective or over-arching storyline, the party might stay together to defeat the greater evil, even if they aren&rsquo;t the best of friends.</p>\n<p>If the campaign goal is more ambiguous, the best answer may be not to force the heroes to stay together. Consider a modern horror game. The players are thrust together in a haunted mansion for a weekend. Terrible things occur, but eventually at least some of the investigators survive and stagger back into daylight. Why would they then go out hunting vampires or searching for zombies the following week just because they had one incredible encounter together?</p>\n<p>Maybe they don&rsquo;t. Maybe they all go home and try to forget what happened just like normal folks. Let a few days or weeks pass where nothing happens (narratively, of course). Later on, one of the characters gets involved in another creepy encounter. Now he knows a few others who might believe his wild tale so he calls for help.</p>\n<h3>Friction</h3>\n<p>So what happens if your group doesn&rsquo;t get along? That depends on whether it&rsquo;s the players or the characters who are arguing.</p>\n<p>We won&rsquo;t give you advice on how to handle conflicts with your friends. You know them best and will have to figure out if there are certain individuals who just don&rsquo;t fit in this campaign. Remember though that friends are more important than games&mdash;even this one. If you and the rest of the group can&rsquo;t talk out your differences, find something else to do for a while that doesn&rsquo;t cause such friction.</p>\n<p>Maybe you can come back to the game once you&rsquo;ve worked things out.</p>\n<p>Friction between characters, on the other hand, is not only fine, it&rsquo;s actually encouraged to some degree. Any interesting group of personalities squabble and argue on occasion. As long as this is done in character it adds to the roleplaying experience and the depth of your campaign. Quiet fights between the heroes can often take on a life of their own, encouraging players to take you, the Game Master, aside or write you private notes about actions their heroes perform away from the prying eyes of others. Intrigue and betrayal are integral to good dramatic stories. Just make sure the group talks things out and keeps the conflict to their characters; not real life.</p>\n<img src=\"modules/swade-core-rules/assets/art/intrigue.webp\" alt=\"Image of a medieval masquerade party, with a man and woman whispering to each other in the shadows.\" />\n<h2>Campaign Types</h2>\n<p>Different groups like different types of games. Some like lots of combat, others want to explore the world, and some are into deep roleplaying and storytelling. Most people like a good mix. Here are some pointers on each.</p>\n<h3>Hack and Slash</h3>\n<p>A hack and slash game features lots of combat. With <cite>Savage Worlds</cite>, you can do more than pit your five player characters against a couple of orcs and an ogre. You can throw a <em>whole horde</em> at your heroes and give them a few staunch @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.盟友]{盟友} or henchmen to help as well!</p>\n<p>The best part is that players who just want to wade into the forces of darkness with two blades slashing can do that too. More tactically-minded players can load up on @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.专长]{Leadership Edges} and direct the actions of hirelings and allies.</p>\n<p>Players who like to think on their feet can use the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.援助]{援助} and @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.考验]{考验} rules to defeat foes without ever making a single attack!</p>\n<p>Some disparage hack and slash campaigns these days, but there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with enjoying a good tactical combat either&mdash;and there can be epic roleplaying even in the middle of massive fights.</p>\n<h3>Exploration</h3>\n<p>Wandering through lost cities, finding forgotten treasures, or reclaiming fallen civilizations is exciting for explorer-types. The Great Unknown lurks behind every pile of toppled columns, and incredible treasures await those brave enough to take them from their mysterious guardians.</p>\n<p>The trouble with exploration games is that they&rsquo;re often difficult for you, the Game Master, to create. All those incredible surprises, fearsome beasts, and awesome treasures have to be created, of course. Fortunately, <cite>Savage Worlds</cite> makes it easy to quickly create just about any creature, magic item, or other surprise you can dream up.</p>\n<p>One important tip here. The players don&rsquo;t have access to your creatures&rsquo; statistics unless you show them. If you describe mysterious creatures of different shapes and sizes, they won&rsquo;t know they&rsquo;re all basically the same stats with just cosmetic or descriptive differences.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s hard to describe wonders in a game and keep them exciting. Ancient vases, strange pictograms, and archaeological sites set a great tone for exploration-style games but unless they convey meaning or occasionally provide some sort of game effect players can get bored quickly. It&rsquo;s hard for most to stay excited about detailed descriptions of Etruscan urns. Give them an occasional urn with a hidden bag of gold coins, or better yet an ancient wine that miraculously relieves @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.疲乏]{疲乏}, and they&rsquo;ll be much more interested in sifting through the ruins.</p>\n<h3>Roleplaying</h3>\n<p>Perhaps the trickiest type of campaign to run is one that involves deep roleplaying. It&rsquo;s easy to handle rules-wise&mdash;there likely won&rsquo;t be much die rolling. The tricky part is knowing when to push the team into a new situation or event and when to just let them talk to each other or your @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.不羁角色与龙套们]{非玩家角色}.</p>\n<p>Being able to create characters and creatures on the fly helps tremendously here. You can jot down a few notes about a character&rsquo;s most important @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.专长]{专长}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.负赘]{负赘}, or @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性]{技能} and move on. That way you can concentrate on giving your @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.不羁角色与龙套们]{龙套} more personality and worry less about calculating their @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.角色]{Parry or Toughness}&mdash;at least until they get into a fight!</p>\n<p>Another thing to be careful about when running a game that&rsquo;s heavy on roleplaying is making sure there are at least a few events scheduled to give the group something to talk about. If the majority of your adventure is a bunch of people standing in a room, you&rsquo;re likely in for a slow night. If they&rsquo;re in a room trying to find out which one of them is a murderer, the action will likely be quite exciting. And if the lights occasionally go out and another victim turns up dead, the interaction between characters can easily get as exciting as the most knock-down, drag-out dungeon crawl.</p>\n<h2>Horror</h2>\n<p>Most every game has an element of horror to it. New Game Masters often ask how to handle horror in their games. They have visions in their heads of their friends sitting around shivering in utter terror as gruesome fiends stalk their underpowered investigators.</p>\n<p>In our experience, that&rsquo;s not very likely. There may certainly be moments like that, but more often your group will be sitting around eating nachos and making bad jokes to each other. The worst thing you can do is try and stop them. Remember they&rsquo;re there to have a good time and socialize while exercising their own imaginations. Let them enjoy themselves and don&rsquo;t try to be overly oppressive with the spooky stuff.</p>\n<p>When the time comes and the weirdness begins, subtly change the tone a bit. Smile and dim the lights, then turn on some creepy music&mdash;just loud enough for them to hear it without being intrusive. If what you&rsquo;re running is genuinely creepy, your group will be relaxed and willing to go with the flow and let the heebie-jeebies take over. Try and <em>force</em> them and it will almost certainly backfire.</p>\n<p>Whatever you do, when the group finally encounters some horrid monster, make sure to describe it rather than refer to it by name. A &ldquo;large, lanky, green-skinned creature with drool dripping from its fangs and beady black eyes&rdquo; is much more frightening than &ldquo;a troll.&rdquo;</p>\n<img src=\"modules/swade-core-rules/assets/art/pg197_quote_horror.webp\" />\n<div class=\"section-header\">\n<h1>Running the Game</h1>\n</div>\n<p><cite>Savage Worlds</cite> has been designed from the ground up to make the job of the Game Master as easy as possible. The designers want you to concentrate on making incredible and exciting memories with your friends. We aren&rsquo;t interested in spending hours before the game creating statistics for Karlos the Innkeeper.</p>\n<p>That means you can concentrate on creating intricate plots, tricky puzzles, and interesting characters. You don&rsquo;t have to do complex math to make your nonplayer characters and monsters, and you certainly don&rsquo;t need to spend more than a minute or two to make up bandits for a quick ambush.</p>\n<p>Your job is kept easy during the game as well since there&rsquo;s very little bookkeeping. You might have to track a few @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.不羁角色与龙套们]{不羁角色} villains&rsquo; @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.伤害效果]{损伤}, but other than that, the foes are up and acting normally, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.伤害效果]{动摇}, or removed from play. You can focus on describing the action instead of trying to record &ldquo;2 hit points of damage on the skeleton figure with the chipped paint on his sword.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Take advantage of these things to give yourself a break and run a game like you never have before. If you want to spend a lot of time on your campaign, make some cool props, work on your plots and subplots, and give your monsters a few memorable Special Abilities (and maybe even playtest them all by yourself to make sure they work how you want).</p>\n<h2>Introducing New Players</h2>\n<p>Getting your friends to try a new game, especially if they&rsquo;re used to one system and don&rsquo;t like to try many others, can be pretty difficult. We recommend printing the free Test Drive rules from our website and giving them to each of your friends. This will show them what <cite>Savage Worlds</cite> is all about and encourage them to try it at least once. If you run one of the free adventures from our site with pregenerated characters from one of our settings it should be very easy for everyone to jump in, play a short session, and figure out if it&rsquo;s for them. We hope it is of course.</p>\n<p>If so, you can then try one of our more involved settings, like <cite>Deadlands</cite>, <cite>Necessary Evil</cite>, <cite>Rippers</cite>, one of our excellent licensees&rsquo; worlds, or even one of your own creation. You can also convert your favorite game world into the <cite>Savage Worlds</cite> rules.</p>\n<h2>Balance</h2>\n<p>Some games have very strict rules for how to balance encounters so that every fight is &ldquo;fair.&rdquo; The battle might be a tough one, but it&rsquo;s still expected the heroes can win if they play smart and have decent luck.</p>\n<p>In <cite>Savage Worlds</cite>, most set piece encounters should be reasonably balanced for the expected power level of the group, but this isn&rsquo;t always the case. Sometimes it&rsquo;s just as interesting for the players to evaluate a situation and realize they probably can&rsquo;t win&mdash;at least not by charging in guns blazing. This is desirable on occasion as it encourages the group to think, talk, plan, and come up with clever solutions to the most challenging situations.</p>\n<p>Game Masters should never be afraid to let the opposition flex their muscles. These are <em>savage</em> worlds, after all, and triumphing against these foes should be a major accomplishment&mdash;not a given.</p>\n<p>That brings us to failure. If a monster or villain defeats the party, take a moment to talk to the group and remind them that the greatest heroes often experience such setbacks. How they pick themselves up and carry on after is what truly defines them.</p>\n<p>Failure is also often more <em>interesting</em> than success. Say a young lord challenges a barbarian to a one-on-one fight to bring peace to their lands. The young lord loses and the player characters assigned to protect him decide to violate the rules of the truce. They step in and kill the barbarian champion! The noble is now disgraced but must somehow continue to lead those who sacrificed their own honor to save him.</p>\n<h3>Crafting A Challenge</h3>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve played Savage Worlds for a while you should have a good feel for how many foes to throw at your adventurers. Here&rsquo;s some general advice, but make sure to think about additional advantages either side might have (traps, support, powerful magic items, or favorable terrain).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Novice Wild Card hero with at least some combat ability should be able to take on three average foes (those with mostly d6s in everything and normal arms and armor), or two foes with better skills, arms, or armor.</li>\n<li>As the party&rsquo;s @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.升级]{位阶} increases, the number or quality of foes should increase as well.</li>\n<li>A good fight for a party of heroes is two @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.不羁角色与龙套们]{龙套} per hero plus an enemy @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.不羁角色与龙套们]{不羁角色} leader with roughly the same number of combat @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.专长]{专长} (or other advantages).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Experiment with these compositions until you have a feel for the game. Then you can try more powerful opponents or increased numbers of less powerful foes.</p>\n<p>If a fight is going poorly, you don&rsquo;t have to &ldquo;fudge&rdquo; the rivals&rsquo; dice rolls or put them down when the situation didn&rsquo;t really deserve it. That feels cheap and undeserved to the players. Instead, reward the heroes with @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.助力点]{助力点} when you have the chance. That will help them succeed when they need to and Soak Wounds.</p>\n<p>But also&hellip;<strong>don&rsquo;t be afraid to let them fail</strong>. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be a TPK (Total Party Kill). Maybe they wake up in their enemy&rsquo;s dungeons or are bound and on a train to some distant locale. Both are just excuses for new adventures and obstacles to overcome&mdash;not the end of the campaign.</p>\n<img src=\"modules/swade-core-rules/assets/art/battle.webp\" alt=\"Image of Red with glowing fire fists getting ready to take on an army of Ninjas.\" />\n<h2>Experience</h2>\n<p>In general, player characters at the start of <cite>Savage Worlds</cite> campaigns are of Novice Rank. They have a little training and talent but haven&rsquo;t had many adventures on their own yet.</p>\n<p>This bears repeating: Novice characters are &ldquo;novices.&rdquo; They have a little more skill and ability than most but are only just beginning their careers. They aren&rsquo;t expected to take on dragons or arch villains&mdash;they&rsquo;re expected to <em>earn</em> their way to those penultimate confrontations.</p>\n<p>Of course, that&rsquo;s a typical campaign. You may also want to start with more experienced characters. That&rsquo;s encouraged for really difficult worlds or for shorter campaigns where the heroes need to get to the heart of the action a little quicker. A commando raid in <cite>Weird War Two</cite>, an assault on a lich&rsquo;s lair, or super spies infiltrating a diabolical villain&rsquo;s base are not adventures for the untrained.</p>\n<p>If you do start with experienced heroes, make sure players create their characters as Novices and <em>then</em> @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.升级]{升级} them normally. That ensures Edges, ability points, and powers are purchased correctly so that characters retain the balance built into each of those systems.</p>\n<p>Start experienced characters as Seasoned, or very rarely, Veterans, when first trying this out. Once you have a good feel for it, you can go as high as you want. A tournament of Legendary characters is an amazing spectacle!</p>\n<h2>Bennies</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.助力点]{助力点} are the true economy of <em>Savage Worlds</em>. They allow you to reward creative players for their actions, entertaining the group, and playing in character.</p>\n<p>New <cite>Savage Worlds</cite> Game Masters often forget to award them or are afraid Bennies will make things too easy for the party. They won&rsquo;t. When players have lots of Bennies, they tend to spend them on what&rsquo;s important to their character rather than just hoarding them to stay alive. If Bennies are scarce, they&rsquo;ll definitely do the latter, and, the game&rsquo;s balance is built around their constant flow. Remember that the rerolls they grant guarantee <em>nothing</em>. A player might spend five Bennies on a simple Notice roll and still fail. It&rsquo;s not likely, but it&rsquo;s definitely possible.</p>\n<p>So when do you award them? Anytime a player does something clever, finds an important clue, or roleplays his character, particularly if it involves their @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.负赘]{负赘} or background. If a Loyal character jeopardizes his life to save his comrade, he definitely deserves a Benny for his efforts. If a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-hindrances.缓慢]{缓慢} hero tells the others to go on while he stays back to fight the pack of wolves at their heels because he knows he&rsquo;s slowing down the rest of the group, reward him for it!</p>\n<p>It also never hurts to reward a player for a great line, side-splitting in-game joke; or even better when she pulls off a serious and dramatic moment.</p>\n<p>Once a player has been rewarded for some&shy;thing, you can stop or slow down rewarding the same behavior. A running joke shouldn&rsquo;t grant a Benny every time it&rsquo;s mentioned, for example. Risking real danger for the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-hindrances.英雄本色]{英雄本色} Hindrance, however, should almost always result in a reward.</p>\n<p>Bennies usually flow at the start of the adventure as players roleplay and get used to the game. They slow down later once those traits have been rewarded a few times already. By the climax, Bennies might be fairly scarce, both in the players&rsquo; stacks and as rewards.</p>\n<p>Then they have to rely on Jokers or those really big moments for rewards&mdash;jumping on the dragon&rsquo;s back, leaping through a stained glass window, a particularly good @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.嘲弄]{嘲弄} against the villain, and so on.</p>\n<h2>Interpret The Die Rolls</h2>\n<p><cite>Savage Worlds</cite> frequently features wild and unpredictable @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性投骰]{die rolls}. When this happens, go with it! If a hero has to jump from a wrecked car as it careens out of control and makes an amazing @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.运动]{运动} roll, describe how he leaps into the air, tucks and rolls on the ground, and comes up on his feet with perfect balance. Similarly, don&rsquo;t be afraid to throw some bad luck at him when he gets a really poor roll. Maybe while using the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.追逐与载具]{追逐} rules a player skis down a mountain to escape a rampaging yeti and rolls @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性投骰]{snake eyes}! Describe how he tumbles, rolling and tumbling through the cold, wet snow as the beast bounds after his fallen prey.</p>\n<p>Your players will love the extra embellish&shy;ment. They&rsquo;ll feel powerful and cool when the dice are nice, and danger and excitement when the dice betray them, especially if you take a moment to make the setback interesting. That&rsquo;s what makes a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性投骰]{大失败} on a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.格斗]{格斗} attack, for example, go from feeling like a lost turn to a memorable part of the story.</p>\n<h2>Pacing</h2>\n<p>A good Game Master must pay attention to the pace of the game. Sometimes your friends will want to take their time roleplaying their characters, interacting with the world, or even just joking out of character and enjoying the social aspect of the game. If this goes on too long, however, they may need a little prodding.</p>\n<p>This can be especially true in open adventures such as a murder mystery that requires the players to figure out where their characters go and what they should do (as opposed to a dungeon crawl or similar adventure where they really only need to decide if they&rsquo;re pressing forward or not).</p>\n<p>If most or all of the group is roleplaying, smiling, and having a good time&mdash;leave them alone. Let them set the tempo. If you notice some of your players are left out or looking a little bored, prod the group to see what they want to next. If they seem lost as to what to do next, ask one of the group to recount the clues or situation as they understand it. This is often enough to spark an idea or lead they want to follow up on. You might also introduce new information via a call or visit from a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.不羁角色与龙套们]{nonplayer character}.</p>\n<p>Finally, don&rsquo;t be afraid to contrive an encounter that gives the group a new path to follow. Maybe the team is attacked by their rivals and in the aftermath are able to gather a new clue from the survivors.</p>\n<h3>Combat Pacing</h3>\n<p>Just as important as keeping the plot moving forward is making sure combats are fast and furious. As you count down the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.行动卡 (先攻)]{行动卡}, make each player tell you what his character is doing fairly quickly. If he needs a moment, put his character on @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.待机]{待机} and move on to the next player.</p>\n<p>If you feel the scene should be particularly dramatic and a player doesn&rsquo;t announce his character&rsquo;s intentions quickly enough, start counting down&hellip; &ldquo;What do you do? 5, 4, 3&hellip;!&rdquo; That will get all the players&rsquo; blood pumping and reinforce the notion that their characters are in a dangerous situation that requires quick decisions and big heroics. Most of the time, rush things along. Make them feel the urgency of combat. Make them a little nervous. Make them realize things are desperate and that the next die roll better be a good one.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s not to say there aren&rsquo;t times when you want to give a player a moment to think&mdash;particularly if they have a big plan or need to look up something really important, like the details of a power or a special rule.</p>\n<p>You might also occasionally give the entire group a moment. If a terrible foe shows up after a few rounds of combat, a quick bathroom break gives everyone a moment to soak in the fact that things just got more challenging.</p>\n<p>Feel the moment and play up the drama befitting your scenario, the environment, and the party&rsquo;s mood, and let them plan and strategize a bit if it makes sense or will benefit the game.</p>\n<img src=\"modules/swade-core-rules/assets/art/pg201_quote_pacing.webp\" alt=\"I read once that extras can usually only take one wound so they're 'up, down, or off the table!' That keeps things fast, furious, and fun and is kinda the core of how combat works for the baddies. &mdash; The GM'\" /> <img src=\"modules/swade-core-rules/assets/art/yeti.webp\" alt=\"An image of a large snow monster.\" />\n<h2>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.不羁角色与龙套们]{龙套}</h2>\n<p>The backbone of any good game is the world that surrounds the player characters, and nonplayer characters are a big part of that. This section shows you how to breathe life into the supporting cast of your world.</p>\n<h3>Creating Extras</h3>\n<p>Consider this Game Master&rsquo;s Rule #1 when it comes to Extras: <strong>Don&rsquo;t &ldquo;build&rdquo; them!</strong></p>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t create your Extras with the character creation rules. Just give them what you think they ought to have in their various skills and attributes and move on. The game is supposed to be easy for you to set up, run, and play. Don&rsquo;t sit around adding up skill points for Extras when you could be designing fiendish traps and thinking up nasty Special Abilities for your monsters!</p>\n<h3>Personality</h3>\n<p>Far more important than most nonplayer character&rsquo;s statistics are their personalities. Jot down a note or two about any Extras the party is likely to come across so you&rsquo;ll have some idea how to run them. Some Game Masters find it useful to identify prominent Extras with actors or characters from film, television, books, or comics.</p>\n<p>Knowing that the Captain of the City Guard is &ldquo;played by Sam Elliot,&rdquo; for instance, gives you a good handle on how to handle interactions with him. He&rsquo;s likely to be gruff, to the point, and have a deep, throaty voice.</p>\n<p>Adding these additional touches to the characters can really make them stand out and be remembered. The grizzled sergeant of the city watch becomes a memorable character they may call on in the future rather than just a momentary encounter they forget by the next scene. Not every Extra needs this kind of depth, of course, but those that do add a level of realism, continuity, and most importantly immersion to your game.</p>\n<h3>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.盟友]{盟友}</h3>\n<p>Though it&rsquo;s rarely written, most games assume the Game Master controls the nonplayer characters, both when they&rsquo;re being talked to and when they fight alongside the player characters in combat. The latter is a burden for the GM, who often simply forgets about the additional characters during a fight, or shoves them off to the side and narratively describes what happens to them. This goes for hirelings as well as animal companions, sidekicks, or love interests. The simple fact is that in most games, allies are a cumbersome complication.</p>\n<p><cite>Savage Worlds</cite> takes a very different approach&mdash;we turn control of allies over to the player characters. The GM acts out these allies when they&rsquo;re spoken to, of course, but should very rarely, if ever, take them over in combat.</p>\n<p>If you allow your heroes to have allies, you can include all the minions your villains should have as well. Picture an ancient lich in his unholy tomb. Would he be sitting there alone? No, he&rsquo;d be surrounded by scores of ghoulish undead. These lesser minions make great complications for your battles and your players will have fun bashing through them with the Extras while their heroes battle the lich and his named lieutenants.</p>\n<p>This takes a little getting used to if you&rsquo;ve been Game Mastering other games for a long time. We suggest you try it for a bit and see how it works out. You can always change if it doesn&rsquo;t make sense for your group.</p>\n<h3>Artificial Inflation</h3>\n<p>When running <cite>Savage Worlds</cite>, a lot of Game Masters become extremely enamored with the ally aspect of the game. Sometimes that leads to very large parties of player characters and their followers, which then demands very large parties of opponents.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s okay if you do this&mdash;the system can handle it&mdash;but be warned that a combat with 50+ combatants will take a bit, even with a fast and furious system like this one!</p>\n<img src=\"modules/swade-core-rules/assets/art/pg202_quote_extras.webp\" alt=\"Nate and Emily hate it when I do the Cackler's crazy laugh. I have to make sure to do it more often! &mdash; The GM\" /></div>\n</div>"

One week we might be inspired to run something like <em>Game of Thrones</em>&reg; and another we want to share a cool idea inspired by the <em>Avengers</em>&reg;.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And while we love learning new game systems and seeing what our friends and peers have created, we also like having a system we know like the back of our hands to fall back on, one that combines the crunch of miniatures-oriented gameplay with the ease of &ldquo;theatre of the mind&rdquo; and the creative outlet of the most modern narrative-based play.</p>\n<p>Each new printing of <cite>Savage Worlds</cite> has added to the experience, carefully integrating new styles of play through the years with the solid foundation laid at the very beginning.</p>\n<p>This version of <cite>Savage Worlds</cite> is what we hope is our best attempt yet at accommodating not just every era, genre, and setting, but most every <em>play style</em> as well.</p>\n<p>Want to sit around on couches and carry out most of the tale through talk and a few die rolls? It&rsquo;s here.</p>\n<p>Want to break out miniatures and have a massive knock-down, drag-out fight? Everything you need is here.</p>\n<p>Need to tell an epic story that&rsquo;s mostly roleplaying and narrative? Nothing&rsquo;s stopping you&mdash;and sub-systems like Quick Encounters can help you sum up bloody conflicts along the way if pressed for time.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the best thing a game system can do is support <em>your</em> ideas. It should serve as background and a common language for your players&mdash;then get out of the way as the story races to its conclusion. We&rsquo;ve attempted to make that even better in this edition by streamlining many modifiers, simplifying how you pose creative challenges for foes and support your allies, and even opening up new options for heroic multi-actions.</p>\n<p>Enough talk. Grab your dice. It&rsquo;s time to get savage!</p>\n</main><img src=\"modules/swade-core-rules/assets/art/pg0_quote_gmintro.webp\" alt=\"Hi!

			"description": "<div class=\"swade-core\">\n<div class=\"section-header\">\n<h1>Mass Battles</h1>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Many adventures feature heroes traveling about the land, gathering allies to thwart some inevitable foe or loathsome horde. They build coalitions, train armies, discover powerful artifacts, and finally stand against the enemy in desperate and glorious battle.</p>\n<p>The rules presented here allow the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Game Mastering]{Game Master} to handle everything from a small warband holding a fort against an undead horde to full divisions of troops fighting a massive field battle or a planetary assault from a space-based invasion fleet. It&rsquo;s abstract, but provides a narrative base for heroes to plan, get involved, and take part in the carnage!</p>\n<p><strong>When to Use These Rules: </strong>Use the Mass Battle rules when you need to resolve a large conflict that can go either way, and also allow the player characters to have a role in its outcome. The culmination of these tales is not always a foregone conclusion, and failure can be just as interesting as victory!</p>\n<p><strong>The Basics: </strong>Each side has a number of &ldquo;Force Tokens&rdquo; equal to its relative strength and size. Commanders roll their Battle skill each turn. The winner reduces his rival&rsquo;s force until one side or the other breaks.</p>\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n<p>To start, give the larger or more powerful army 10 Force Tokens. Give the opposing army a proportional number of tokens. If one army has 10,000 warriors, for example, and the other has 7,000, give the smaller army seven tokens. These represent the troops, vehicles, ships, etc., in each side&rsquo;s army.</p>\n<p>Adjust the ratio as makes sense to account for special or elite troops, better equipment, and so on. If one army is half as powerful as another, for example, give one side 10 Force Tokens and the other five. Get close enough to give a reasonable approximation of relative strength. The dice and the players&rsquo; actions will handle the rest.</p>\n<h2>Battle</h2>\n<p>At the start of each round, the player characters discuss and decide on their plan.</p>\n<p>Next comes opposed Battle rolls by the rival commanders. Add the modifiers below as appropriate to each roll.</p>\n<table class=\"table value-table\"><caption class=\"table-caption\">\n<h2 class=\"table-title\">Battle Modifiers</h2>\n</caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"table-header-row\">\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Modifier</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Circumstance</th>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>+1 per point of advantage</td>\n<td><strong>Force Bonus:</strong> The side with the most Force Tokens adds +1 for each point of difference. If the larger army has 10 tokens and the smaller one has 7, for example, the commander of the more powerful army adds +3.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>+1 to +4</td>\n<td><strong>Tactical Advantage:</strong> Grant a +1 to +4 bonus for any special cir&shy;cumstances that might help that army, such as air superiority, fortifications, or other conditions not otherwise factored into the army&rsquo;s strength.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>+1 to +4</td>\n<td><strong>Battle Plan:</strong> Add +1 to +4 if one side has a particularly effective or clever plan over the other.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Results</h3>\n<p>The winner of the opposed roll consults the Battle Results. Any casualties are generally distributed evenly throughout the army or however the GM feels is most appropriate.</p>\n<table class=\"table value-table\"><caption class=\"table-caption\">\n<h2 class=\"table-title\">Battle Results</h2>\n</caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"table-header-row\">\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Modifier</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Result</th>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Tie</td>\n<td><strong>Draw: </strong>Both sides lose one Force Token.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Success</td>\n<td><strong>Success: </strong>The victor loses one Force Token, the defeated loses two.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Raise</td>\n<td><strong>Victory: </strong>The defeated army loses two Force Tokens.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Time:</strong> A standard battle round is two hours of hard fighting. The Game Master should change this as suits her needs or the story. A more reserved fight might have four- or even eight-hour rounds, while a siege might be a battle round per day.</p>\n<h3>Morale</h3>\n<p>After an army loses one or more Force Tokens, its leader rolls his @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性投骰]{心魂} modified by these circumstances:</p>\n<table class=\"table value-table\"><caption class=\"table-caption\">\n<h2 class=\"table-title\">Morale Modifiers</h2>\n</caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"table-header-row\">\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Modifier</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Circumstance</th>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>-1</td>\n<td>Each Force Token lost so far.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>The army is made up mostly of undead or other fearless troops.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>The army is within fortifications or prepared positions.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>The army cannot retreat or will be killed if it does.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Success means he cajoles the army to fight on. The battle continues another round (or as the attacker sees fit).</p>\n<p>Failure means the commander loses control of his force. The army is defeated but conducts an orderly retreat. @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性投骰]{大失败} means they flee the field in a reckless rout. They may be scattered temporarily or permanently, ridden down by the enemy, or captured as the GM decides.</p>\n<h3>Aftermath</h3>\n<p>When one side routs, retreats, or runs out of Force Tokens, the battle ends. If it&rsquo;s important to determine the fate of named Extras or other nonplayer characters, use the <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.医疗]{Aftermath &amp; Extras}</strong>&nbsp;rules.</p>\n<h2>Characters In Mass Battles</h2>\n<p>Player characters can dramatically affect the results of the battle. Before their commander makes his Battle roll, each player who wants to enter the fray describes what she&rsquo;s doing and makes a Support roll with whatever skill she feels is most appropriate. (Don&rsquo;t forget that enemy champions can add to the rival commander&rsquo;s Battle roll as well!)</p>\n<p>Success grants the commander +1 to his Battle roll but the hero takes @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.疲乏]{疲乏} from <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.冲撞s and Bruises]{Bumps &amp; Bruises}</strong>&nbsp;for her efforts. With a raise, she emerges unharmed and rolls on the <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-tables.作战 Effects]{Battle Effects}</strong>&nbsp;table. She may choose to use the result rolled or give her commander the usual +2 bonus instead.</p>\n<p>Failure means the warrior fought bravely. She takes a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.伤害效果]{损伤} but doesn&rsquo;t add to the commander&rsquo;s Battle roll. A @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性投骰]{大失败} means the hero rolls on the <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-tables.作战 Effects]{Battle Effects}</strong>&nbsp;table but also suffers d4+1 Wounds!</p>\n<p>The Game Master and players should work together to describe each character&rsquo;s glorious scenes of bravery and carnage once the results are determined.</p>\n<h3>Ammo &amp; Power Points</h3>\n<p>If it&rsquo;s important to track, each round a hero enters the fray and uses his @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.射击]{射击} or an @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.奥法背景]{奥法技能} he expends some of his @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.弹药 Table]{弹药} or @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.奥法背景]{获得奇术点}.</p>\n<p>Arcane types use 3d6 Power Points each round of battle. Characters with @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.射程d Weapons Table]{ranged weapons} fire at their weapon&rsquo;s standard @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.射速]{射速}, 2d6 times.</p>\n<p>Arcane types use 3d6 Power Points each round of battle. Characters with ranged weapons fire at their weapon&rsquo;s standard Rate of Fire, 2d6 times.</p>\n<p class=\"embedded-example\"><strong>Example: </strong>Gabe is in a mass battle against a horde of xenos. His @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.机枪 Table]{minigun's} RoF is 5 so it fires 40 bullets per shot. He rolls 7 on 2d6, so Gabe uses 7 &times; 40 bullets, or 280 rounds!</p>\n</div>\n</div>"

Instead, the GM describes the scene, then the players agree on a general plan and what each of their characters will do.</p>\n<p>Once everyone states their intent, they can pick the skill that best represents their actions during the encounter.</p>\n<p>Here are some examples:</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>CHASE: </strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.通用知识]{通用知识} (for navi&shy;gation), @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.驾驶]{驾驶}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.修理]{修理}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.射击]{射击}.</li>\n<li><strong>COMBAT: </strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.格斗]{格斗}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.射击]{射击}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.奥法背景]{奥法技能}.</li>\n<li><strong>CRISIS: </strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.骇客]{骇客}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.察觉]{察觉}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.潜行]{潜行}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.贼活]{贼活}.</li>\n<li><strong>HEIST: </strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.通用知识]{通用知识} (for navi&shy;gation), @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.驾驶]{驾驶}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.修理]{修理}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.射击]{射击}.</li>\n<li><strong>MISSION: </strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.作战]{作战}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.驾船]{驾船}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.格斗]{格斗}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.交涉]{交涉}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.航空]{航空}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.射击]{射击}.</li>\n<li><strong>TREK: </strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.通用知识]{通用知识}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.察觉]{察觉}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.生存]{生存}.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Modifiers:</strong> The GM should assign modifiers based on the situation. If the heroes greatly outnumber their opposition, pursue much slower prey, have prior experience with the obstacles in their path, or special equipment to deal with hazards, the roll might be made at +1 to +4.</p>\n<p>Very difficult encounters, such as powerful foes (relative to the party), faster prey, or extreme conditions inflict a &minus;1 to &minus;4 penalty.</p>\n<h3>Turn Order &amp; Critical Actions</h3>\n<p>Players can go in whatever order they want in a Quick Encounter. This might be important if some of their @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.动作]{动作} are dependent on someone else&rsquo;s. In a heist, for example, the group might depend on the hacker to shut down a company&rsquo;s security measures before they can break in. Similarly, the crew of a B-17 in <cite>Weird War Two</cite> might need the navigator to get them to the mission location before they can fend off enemies and bomb a target.</p>\n<p>Resolve these kinds of actions in the order that makes sense, and allow those who come after to change their own plans as the situation changes.</p>\n<p>If a critical task is failed, the GM must decide if it stops the encounter or simply complicates it (perhaps inflicting a penalty to everyone else&rsquo;s roll). In the heist example above, for example, maybe the hacker does break in but alerts the guards, inflicting a &minus;2 penalty to Stealth or combat rolls and possibly turning the operation deadly. In the <cite>Weird War Two</cite> example, the navigator might still get them to the location but arrives just as the enemy fighters respond and make things more difficult.</p>\n<p>These kinds of complications might also mean resolving the encounter in multiple stages instead of one roll as the heroes must react to the changing circumstances (see <strong>Staged Encounters</strong>, immediately below).</p>\n<h3>Staged Encounters</h3>\n<p>Quick Encounters are typically a single die roll followed by some narration between the GM and the players. But some encounters might need additional rounds to better reflect the results or any new information or events that come to light.</p>\n<p>If the heist to break into a pawn shop and steal a powerful occult artifact goes badly, for example, the next stage might become a crisis when the shop suddenly bursts into supernatural flames. That might then lead to a combat encounter as an artifact in the shop breaks and releases an angry djinn!</p>\n<p>The beauty of staged encounters is their ability to handle complex problems when the constraints of time or larger narrative require a speedy resolution.</p>\n<h2>Encounter Results</h2>\n<p>Once each player has determined her @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性]{技能} and any @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.奇术调整]{调整值}, she rolls the dice and works with the Game Master to narrate the details based on the total, the situation, and the other players&rsquo; actions.</p>\n<h3>Dangerous Encounters</h3>\n<p>If a character fails his roll in a dangerous situation he takes a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.伤害效果]{损伤} (or d4 Wounds with a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性投骰]{大失败}). If he&rsquo;s the driver of a vehicle, it takes a Wound (or d4 with a Critical Failure). Wounds may be @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.化解投骰]{化解} as usual.</p>\n<p>Success means the hero emerges with only <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.冲撞s and Bruises]{Bumps &amp; Bruises}</strong>, and a raise means he escapes unscathed.</p>\n<h3>Nonlethal Encounters</h3>\n<p>If the encounter isn&rsquo;t physically dangerous, failure means the hero doesn&rsquo;t contribute to the party&rsquo;s overall success somehow. @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性投骰]{大失败} means she suffers social stigma, loses or breaks a piece of vital equipment, is positively identified, or gets the wrong information. This likely means moving on to a second stage of the encounter as she deals with the fallout of her errors.</p>\n<h3>Success &amp; Failure</h3>\n<p>In general, narration and individual actions determine the success or failure of an encounter. If the hacker can&rsquo;t get past a building&rsquo;s security measures, for example, and the GM decides it shuts down the operation rather than complicating it, the encounter fails. In other words, let the story tell the tale.</p>\n<p>In a more dynamic situation such as @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.战斗]{战斗}, assume the group &ldquo;wins&rdquo; if there are at least as many total successes (one for each success and raise) as there are player characters. They get the information, drive off their foes, complete the mission, or avert (or escape) the crisis. @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.援助]{援助} rolls <em>don&rsquo;t</em> count as successes.</p>\n<p>If there are fewer successes than player characters, they fail. Specifics are up to the Game Master, but might mean the party has to fall back or retreat from their foes, their prey escapes, they don&rsquo;t get the object or data they were looking for, they survive the crisis but can&rsquo;t save most of the bystanders, and so on.</p>\n<p>If they can try again, the GM should &ldquo;reset&rdquo; the encounter with the new narrative so the group has to come up with a new plan. And of course, their foes are likely on to them now!</p>\n<h3>Ammo &amp; Power Points</h3>\n<p>Use the rules for<strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.弹药 Table]{弹药} &amp;@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.奥法背景]{获得奇术点}</strong>&nbsp;under <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.集团战斗]{Mass Battles}</strong>&nbsp;for combat encounters if desired. Otherwise the player and GM can just decide what resources were consumed in the encounter.</p>\n<h2 class=\"blue-example\">Example: Night At The Museum</h2>\n<p>Red and Gabe must break into a museum, steal an ancient book, and stop a global conspiracy that threatens all of humanity.</p>\n<p>The group decides to play out the break-in as a Quick Encounter.

If the result is a 4 or better (the &ldquo;Target Number&rdquo; or TN), the action is successful. For example, if a character&rsquo;s @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性]{力量} is a d6, he rolls a six-sided die. On a 4 or better, he&rsquo;s successful.</p>\n<p><strong>Modifiers: </strong>Circumstances modify the die roll, such as shooting at something far away or finding a well-hidden clue. Some things, such as @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.射程]{远程攻击}, have standard modifiers. It&rsquo;s up to the GM to determine any modifiers for more subjective tasks, such as spotting an ambush or eavesdropping on a conversation through a door.</p>\n<p>In general, an easy task, such as finding tracks in the mud, is made at +2. A difficult task, such as finding tracks by torchlight, is made at &minus;2. A very difficult task, such as finding tracks in a rainstorm, is made at &minus;4.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiple Dice: </strong>When a character rolls multiple dice, such as when firing a machine-gun, check each die separately.</p>\n<h3>The Wild Die</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.不羁角色与龙套们]{龙套} roll a single die when making a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性]{特性} roll. @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.不羁角色与龙套们]{不羁角色} roll an extra d6 and take the highest of their @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性]{特性} die or the &ldquo;Wild Die.&rdquo; Both of these dice can Ace (see below).</p>\n<p><strong>One Wild Die Per Action: </strong>When @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.不羁角色与龙套们]{不羁角色} roll multiple dice for a single action, such as when firing a machine gun, they roll only one Wild Die.</p>\n<p>The Wild Die may replace a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性]{特性} die or be ignored&mdash;it never adds another action or attack to the roll.</p>\n<p class=\"embedded-example\"><strong>Example:</strong> Gabe has the <strong>Frenzy Edge</strong> (page 42). He rolls an extra Fighting die when making a melee attack along with a Wild Die. Only two of his dice can cause hits since the Wild Die can only replace a die, not add another attack.</p>\n<h3>Aces</h3>\n<p>All @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性]{特性} and damage rolls in <cite>Savage Worlds</cite> are open-ended. That means that when you roll the highest number possible on a die (a 6 on a d6, an 8 on a d8, and so on), you get to roll that die again and add it to the total. This is called an &ldquo;Ace.&rdquo; Any modifiers to the die roll should be tacked on after adding up an Aced roll.</p>\n<p class=\"embedded-example\"><strong>Example: </strong>Red attempts to leap a dangerous ice chasm. She&rsquo;s a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.不羁角色与龙套们]{不羁角色} with a d8 in @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.运动]{运动}, so she rolls a d8 and a d6 and takes the highest result. In this case, both dice Ace (8 on the d8 and 6 on the d6). She rolls the d8 again and gets a 4 for a total of 12. She rolls the d6 again and gets another 6, followed by a 2&mdash;that&rsquo;s a total of 14. Red leaps the chasm with ease&hellip;this time!</p>\n<h3>Raises</h3>\n<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s important to know just how successful a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性]{特性} roll was. Every 4 points over the Target Number is called a &ldquo;raise.&rdquo; If your hero needs a 4 to shoot an opponent and rolls an 11, he hits with one raise (and would have two raises with a roll of 12). Figure raises after adjusting for any modifiers.</p>\n<p>A single raise always provides an additional effect of some sort, such as bonus damage when attacking or a benefit determined by the GM for other rolls.</p>\n<h3>Opposed Rolls</h3>\n<p>Sometimes rolls are &ldquo;opposed&rdquo; by an opponent. The attacker gets a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性]{特性} total, then the defender attempts to beat it.</p>\n<p>The exact skills or attributes used in a contest are specified in each circumstance, or the GM can decide what makes the most sense.

Sneaking up on someone is a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.潜行]{潜行} roll opposed by @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.察觉]{察觉} (which is detailed in the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.潜行]{潜行} skill description).</p>\n<p>The acting character in an opposed roll always gets his @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性]{特性} total first (including spending any <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.助力点]{助力点}</strong>), and must get at least a basic success (TN 4) or he fails. The defender rolls next and must <em>meet</em> or <em>exceed</em> the first character&rsquo;s result or the attacker wins.</p>\n<p>The winner also uses his opponent&rsquo;s total for purposes of determining raise effects.</p>\n<h3>Critical Failures</h3>\n<p>A Critical Failure occurs when a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.不羁角色与龙套们]{不羁角色} rolls a 1 on both the skill die and Wild Die of a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性]{特性} roll. The attempt automatically fails and something bad happens&mdash;a weapon is dropped or gets stuck, the attack hits a friend, the vehicle crashes, spells misfire (see <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.启动]{反冲}</strong>), and so on.</p>\n<p>Critical Failures cannot be rerolled, even with <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.助力点]{助力点}</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Extras and Critical Failures:</strong> If an @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.不羁角色与龙套们]{龙套} rolls a 1 on a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性]{特性} check and it&rsquo;s important to know if it&rsquo;s a Critical Failure, such as when casting a spell, roll a d6. On a 1, it&rsquo;s a Critical Failure. Otherwise it&rsquo;s just a normal failure.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiple Dice:</strong> Some abilities allow char&shy;acters to roll multiple @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性]{特性} dice, such as the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-edges.连击]{连击} Edge or firing a weapon with a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.射速]{射速} higher than 1. A Critical Failure with multiple dice occurs when more than half the die results are a natural 1. If the character is a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.不羁角色与龙套们]{不羁角色}, the Wild Die <em>must</em> be a 1 as well.</p>\n<p class=\"embedded-example\"><strong>Example: </strong>Gabe fires the auto-cannon of a high-tech hovercraft. It has a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.射速]{射速} of 3 so he rolls three @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.射击]{射击} dice and one Wild Die. If three or more of the dice come up 1s, including the Wild Die, it&rsquo;s a Critical Failure.</p>\n<h3>Unskilled Attempts</h3>\n<p>If a character doesn&rsquo;t have a skill for an action he&rsquo;s attempting, he rolls a d4 for his skill die (and a Wild Die if a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.不羁角色与龙套们]{不羁角色}) and subtracts 2 from the total.</p>\n<p>The GM may decide certain tasks cannot be attempted unskilled, such as performing complex surgery or flying a commercial jet.</p>\n<h3>Reroll</h3>\n<p>Some @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.专长]{专长} or abilities allow a character to reroll @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性]{特性} (as long as they&rsquo;re not a Critical Failure). To do so, roll <em>all</em> the dice again and get a new total. You may keep any of the totals generated, so rerolls never make things <em>worse</em> unless you roll a Critical Failure. This ends all rerolls immediately and becomes the result of the attempt&mdash;that&rsquo;s the risk one takes in pushing the limits!</p>\n<p>Multiple rerolls are allowed from different @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.专长]{专长}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.助力点]{助力点}, or other abilities.</p>\n<h3>Group Rolls</h3>\n<p>When you want to make a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性]{特性} roll for a group of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.不羁角色与龙套们]{龙套} with like Traits, roll one Trait die as usual along with a Wild Die and treat this as the group&rsquo;s result. This gives a decent average without making rolls for every individual.</p>\n<p class=\"embedded-example\"><strong>Example: </strong>A group of soldiers attempts to slip through Gabe&rsquo;s sensors. The GM rolls their @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.潜行]{潜行} die (a d6) and a Wild Die and takes the best of the two as the soldiers&rsquo; total.</p>\n</div>\n</div>"

			"description": "<div class=\"swade-core\">\n<div class=\"section-header\">\n<h1>Traits</h1>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Characters are defined by their &ldquo;Traits,&rdquo; attributes and skills ranked by die types. A d6 is average, while higher die types reflect much greater ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Attributes</strong> are primarily passive or innate abilities used for resisting effects like fear or supernatural attacks. <strong>Skills</strong> are used to <em>actively</em> do things or affect others.</p>\n<p>Exceptions occur, but these are the foundational differences between the two concepts.</p>\n<h2>Attributes</h2>\n<p>Attributes don&rsquo;t directly affect skill rolls. <em>Savage Worlds</em> treats learned knowledge and training as the most relevant and direct factors. A high attribute allows one to increase a skill faster and opens up options to Edges that greatly differentiate two characters with the same skill.</p>\n<p>Every character starts with a d4 in each of five attributes:</p>\n<p><strong>Agility</strong> is a measure of a character&rsquo;s nimble&shy;ness, dexterity, and general coordination.</p>\n<p><strong>Smarts</strong> measures raw intelligence, mental acuity, and how fast a heroine thinks on her feet. It&rsquo;s used to resist certain types of mental and social attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Spirit</strong> is self-confidence, backbone, and willpower. It&rsquo;s used to resist social and supernatural attacks as well as fear.</p>\n<p><strong>Strength</strong> is physical power and fitness. It&rsquo;s also used as the basis of a warrior&rsquo;s damage in hand-to-hand combat, and to determine how much he can wear or carry.</p>\n<p><strong>Vigor</strong> represents an individual&rsquo;s endurance, resistance to disease, poison, or toxins, and how much physical damage she can take before she can&rsquo;t go on. It is most often used to resist Fatigue effects, and as the basis for the derived stat of Toughness.</p>\n<h3>Using Attributes</h3>\n<p>Attributes are used to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Determine how fast skills increase during<strong> @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.升级]{升级}</strong></li>\n<li>Limit access to <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.专长]{专长}</strong></li>\n<li>Derive @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.角色]{secondary statistics} such as Toughness or melee damage.</li>\n<li>Resist effects such as being @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.擒抱]{擒抱} or counter spells, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.奇术]{奇术}, or social attacks such as @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.嘲弄]{嘲弄} or @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.威吓]{威吓}.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Skills</h2>\n<p>Heroes have 12 points to buy skills during character creation. A skill that&rsquo;s below the linked attribute (noted in parentheses beside the skill name) is cheaper to increase than one that&rsquo;s at or above it. See <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.角色创建概要]{Character Creation}</strong> and <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.升级]{升级}.</strong></p>\n<p>Core skills are marked with a <span class=\"red-text\">red star</span>, and start at d4 for@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性投骰]{player characters}.</p>\n<p>Characters can attempt skills they don&rsquo;t have but it&rsquo;s more difficult. See<strong> @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性投骰]{拙劣尝试}</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Skill changes in this edition of Savage Worlds</h2>\n<p>Here's a summary of the most important skill changes in this edition of <cite>Savage Worlds</cite></p>\n<h3>Core Skills</h3>\n<p>Every hero starts with a d4 in five basic abilities: Athletics, Common Knowledge, Notice, Persuasion, and Stealth. A d4 doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re <em>good</em> at these skills, but they have some basic experience with them.</p>\n<p><strong>MAJOR CHANGES:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"red-text\">Charisma</span> was removed from the game</li>\n<li><span class=\"red-text\">Climbing</span> has been folded into @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.运动]{运动}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.通用知识]{通用知识} is now its own skill rather than a Smarts roll</li>\n<li><span class=\"red-text\">Investigation</span> is now @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.调查]{调查} to make its meaning and usage more clear.</li>\n<li>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.集中]{集中} is a new skill for the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.奥法背景 (Gifted)]{Gifted Arcane Background}</li>\n<li><span class=\"red-text\">Knowledge</span> has been broken down into the separate skills used in most campaigns. Specially: <span class=\"red-text\">@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.人文]{人文}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.作战]{作战}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.电子学]{电子学}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.骇客]{骇客}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.语言学]{语言学}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.神秘学]{神秘学},</span> and @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.科学]{科学}</li>\n<li><span class=\"red-text\">Lockpicking</span> is now part of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.贼活]{贼活}, which also handles pickpocketing, slight of hand, safecracking, and other roguish tricks.</li>\n<li>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.表演]{表演} is a new skill</li>\n<li>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.修理]{修理} and its use are better defined.</li>\n<li><span class=\"red-text\">Streetwise</span> is now an @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.专长]{专长</li>\n<li><span class=\"red-text\">Swimming</span> is handled by @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.运动]{运动}</li>\n<li><span class=\"red-text\">Throwing</span> is covered by @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.运动]{运动}</li>\n<li><span class=\"red-text\">Tracking</span> is now part of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.生存]{生存}</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Creating Other Skills</h2>\n<p>Game Masters can create any skill they want or need for their setting. If the skill has defined uses, she should work out exactly how it functions. If navigating the stars is a big part of your planetary romance campaign and you don&rsquo;t think the Electronics skill covers use of the navigational systems, for example, you might want to add Astrogation.</p>\n<p>Players can also add their own specialty skills (with the GM&rsquo;s approval). These aren&rsquo;t likely to come up much in most settings, however, unless the player proactively looks for ways to use them.</p>\n<p class=\"embedded-example\"><strong>Example:</strong> In<em> Deadlands: Hell on Earth</em>, the heroes must rally the town against an approaching mutant horde. Emily has a skill of her own creation, Journalism. She decides to use it to write an emotional article and print it up for everyone in the settlement to read. She gets a raise and the GM decides the entire town rallies to the defenders&rsquo; side.</p>\n<h3>Skill Philosophy</h3>\n<p>New players sometimes focus on some skills being so broad&mdash;such as @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.格斗]{格斗} or @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.射击]{射击}&mdash;and trying to make all other skills equally so. But the primary goal of the skill system is to create and support character tropes. A shooter, whether he&rsquo;s a sniper or a bowman, is ubiquitous across many settings and all use a single ability&mdash;being able to fire weapons accurately. You don&rsquo;t need a skill for firearms and another for bows to reinforce those character tropes.</p>\n<p>Investigators do need many different skills, however, because they do things in completely different ways. A hard-nosed detective needs @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.威吓]{威吓} to work the streets, socialites mingle with high society, bookworms hit the library, and computer geeks use @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.骇客]{骇客} to get what they want.</p>\n<p>Also, some skills just don&rsquo;t make <em>sense</em> when combined. You could combine @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.驾船]{驾船}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.驾驶]{驾驶}, and @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.航空]{航空} into &ldquo;Vehicles,&rdquo; for example, but then every modern day person who can drive a car could fly a plane. Consider that when you&rsquo;re altering skills for your campaigns.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Comprehensive Modifiers</h2>\n<p>Previous editions of <em>Savage Worlds</em> listed a host of modifiers for things like @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.潜行]{潜行} and Tracking (now part of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.生存]{生存}). We&rsquo;ve foregone those tables in this edition for a more subjective stance that allows the GM to look at the entire situation&mdash;something we can&rsquo;t sum up in a table&mdash;and assign a bonus or penalty on her own, usually from +4 to &minus;4.</p>\n<p>This allows her to consider all the factors more generally, especially those that overlap (like dual penalties for rain or darkness that both limit visibility and therefore shouldn&rsquo;t stack) and sum them up quickly and easily without having to consult a table in the middle of a tense scene.</p>\n<br /><br />\n<h2>Familiarization</h2>\n<p>If it&rsquo;s dramatically appropriate to show that a character is out of his element with the particular use of a skill&mdash;such as picking up an alien weapon and trying to make a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.射击]{射击} attack with it&mdash;the GM should simply apply a penalty (usually &minus;2 to &minus;4) to the total.</p>\n<p>When to do this, and how large the penalty is, depends entirely on the situation. A gunslinger might suffer a penalty when using a bow, for example, at least until he&rsquo;s had a day or two to practice. A professor might suffer a &minus;4 to a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.科学]{科学} roll if the player specifically says he&rsquo;s a world famous <em>chemist</em> when the check the GM has called for concerns Paleozoic geology. (Though that&rsquo;s a great time to award a Benny if the player roleplays his lack of knowledge!)</p>\n<p>How long a penalty lasts under repeated use depends on the skill in question. Physical penalties likely fade after a day or so of practice. Penalties for knowledge-based skills are removed if the character spends time researching the subject matter and has access to suitable materials. A French literature major who has time to study up on her Shakespeare, for example, shouldn&rsquo;t suffer a penalty to her @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.人文]{人文}.</p>\n<p>In summary, use familiarization penalties for dramatic use or to illustrate differences in cultures or technology levels. Even then, keep the story moving and don&rsquo;t get bogged down in the minutiae.</p>\n<br /><br />\n<figure class=\"figure table-figure\">\n<figcaption class=\"figure-heading\">Trait Summaries</figcaption>\n<table class=\"table summary-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"table-header-row\">\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Attributes</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span class=\"lead-bold\">Agility:</span> Nimbleness, dexterity, and overall physical coordination of muscles and reflexes.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span class=\"lead-bold\">Smarts:</span> Raw intellect, perception, and ability to sort and make use of complex information.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span class=\"lead-bold\">Spirit:</span> Inner strength and willpower.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span class=\"lead-bold\">Strength:</span> Raw muscle power.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span class=\"lead-bold\">Vigor:</span> Endurance, health, and constitution.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table class=\"table summary-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"table-header-row\">\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Skills</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span class=\"lead-bold\">@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.人文]{人文} (Smarts):</span> Knowledge of liberal arts, social sciences, literature, history, etc.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span class=\"lead-bold core-skill\">@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.运动]{运动} (Agility):</span> Overall athletic coordination and ability.

			"description": "<div class=\"swade-core\">\n<div class=\"section-header\">\n<h1>Trappings</h1>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Trappings allow the core @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.奇术]{奇术} presented in this chapter to have many different appearances. They usually have no game effect on their own, but are important for atmosphere and theme.</p>\n<p>One character might fire a swarm of bees to attack her foes, for example, while another shoots red lasers from her eyes. Both are examples of the <em>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-powers.矢箭]{矢箭}</em> power and share the same mechanics, but they look and are described differently.</p>\n<p>Trappings <em>do</em> matter when an obstacle or opponent has a particular strength or weakness. If an ice troll suffers +4 damage from fire- or heat-based attacks, for example, a blast a player describes as a fireball counts as a fire attack and does +4 damage.</p>\n<p>Once described, a power’s Trappings don’t change without the <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-edges.奇才]{奇才}</strong> Edge, or an @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.升级]{升级}—see below.</p>\n<p>A character can alter the power’s effects as she wishes using the <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.奇术调整]{奇术调整}</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Synergy</h3>\n<p>Sometimes logic dictates a power’s Trapping should have some additional effect. Zapping someone with a lightning bolt while they’re standing in water should cause additional @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.伤害]{伤害}, for example, or less if they’re wearing a rubber hazmat suit.</p>\n<p>When this occurs, the GM can decide there’s synergy that either increases or decreases the effect or damage (GM’s call) by +2 or −2.</p>\n<p>Oppositional forces, such as fire and ice or light and darkness, <em>don’t</em> have synergy against one another (though such effects are sometimes accounted for in some creatures’ @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.怪物图鉴]{特殊能力}). If a fire <em>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-powers.爆发]{爆发}</em> hits ice armor (<em>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-powers.防护]{防护}</em>), for example, there’s no synergy because they cancel each other out.</p>\n<h3>Limitations</h3>\n<p>Sometimes a power’s Trapping imposes a limitation on the power. This gives the power focus at the expense of versatility, reducing the strain it causes the caster.</p>\n<p>The Limitation is permanent and always in effect unless changed with an @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.升级]{升级} as noted below.</p>\n<p>Each limitation placed upon the power reduces its total @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.奥法背景]{奇术点} cost by one (to a minimum of 1). If this would reduce the cost to 0, you gain a +1 bonus (+2 maximum) to the arcane skill total instead.</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.射程]{射程}: </strong>The power’s @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.射程]{射程} is reduced to Touch (and its listed @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.射程]{射程} is greater).</li>\n<li><strong>PERSONAL: </strong>The power's @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.射程]{射程} becomes Self (and has a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.射程]{射程} of Touch or the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.射程]{射程} Limitation above).</li>\n<li><strong>ASPECT: </strong>The character can only access one aspect of a power (that has more than one choice), such as <em>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-powers.滞缓/Speed]{sloth/speed}</em> or <em>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-powers.Boost/Lower Trait]{boost/lower Trait}</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Adding &amp; Changing Trappings</h3>\n<p>A character gets two new @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.奇术]{奇术} when he takes the <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-edges.新奇术]{新奇术}</strong> Edge. He may instead add Trappings to his @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.奇术]{奇术} in place of one or two of the new @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.奇术]{奇术}. A hero who takes the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-edges.新奇术]{新奇术} Edge, for example, could choose one new power and add an ice Trapping to her <em>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-powers.矢箭]{矢箭}</em>.</p>\n<p>The GM may also allow a player to <em>change</em> the trapping of existing power when she gains an @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.升级]{升级}. This should reflect a major change in the character in some way as determined by the player and GM.</p>\n<aside class=\"parchment-torn\">\n<h2>More on Trappings</h2>\n<p>Trappings allow an endless variety of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.奇术]{奇术} and the sources of those @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.奇术]{奇术}. Sometimes that might produce some st@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.射程]{射程} results, so the player and GM must use common sense to figure out any inconsistencies. Here’s an example.</p>\n<p>Gabe is an alchemist in a fantasy game. He decides his blast power manifests as a bag of small, explosive pots he hurls like grenades.</p>\n<p><em>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-powers.爆发]{爆发}</em> has a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.射程]{射程} of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性]{聪慧} ×2. With a d8 @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性]{聪慧}, that’s 16″ with no @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.射程]{射程} penalties. This is sometimes better than using Athletics to throw an actual grenade, which has @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.射程]{射程} penalties at 10″ and 20.” That’s okay—Gabe’s player has to track and use @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.奥法背景]{获得奇术点}. Another character with traditional grenades doesn’t, but must contend with @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.射程]{射程} modifiers.</p>\n</aside>\n</div>\n</div>"

Difficult conditions can drastically decrease progress (or increase it in the case of sailing with strong winds).</p>\n<table class=\"table reverse-value-table\"><caption class=\"table-caption\">\n<h2 class=\"table-title\">Average Travel Times</h2>\n</caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"table-header-row\">\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Transport</th>\n<th class=\"table-column-header\" scope=\"col\">Miles/8 Hour Day</th>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Foot</td>\n<td>24</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Horse</td>\n<td>30</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Early Car</td>\n<td>200</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Modern Car</td>\n<td>400</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sailing Ship*</td>\n<td>30</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Steam Ship*</td>\n<td>40</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Modern Passenger Train</td>\n<td>400</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Prop Plane</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Commerical Jet</td>\n<td>4,000</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><em>*Sailing ships (and steam ships to a lesser degree) are greatly affected by currents and winds. Strong winds or currents in the right direction allow them to travel about 60 miles per day. Poor winds or going against the current reduces them to 20 miles per day or less.</em></p>\n<h2>Encounters</h2>\n<p>If an area is dangerous or lawless, draw a card from the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.行动卡 (先攻)]{Action Deck} once per day (or even two or three times a day in particularly dangerous areas). A face card or higher represents an encounter, and the card suit can be used to determine the type.</p>\n<p>Draw twice more if the card is a Joker and combine the results&mdash;such as Enemies and an Obstacle or Strangers and Treasure (defined below).</p>\n<p>Game Masters are highly encouraged to customize encounters based on their setting.</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>SPADES&mdash;ENEMIES: </strong>Monsters, enemies, or hostile beasts bar the way. Perhaps they lie in ambush if it&rsquo;s a popular path, waiting for the next band of unwary travelers.</li>\n<li><strong>HEARTS&mdash;STRANGERS: </strong>The group comes upon neutral or friendly nonplayer charac&shy;ters such as merchants, lost travelers, a guide, or even other adventurers.</li>\n<li><strong>DIAMONDS&mdash;TREASURE: </strong>Somewhere along the way is something of value&mdash;the hulk of a crashed ship with some remaining supplies waiting to be scavenged, a cache of useful or valuable minerals, or a magic item for sale or guarded by someone or something.</li>\n<li><strong>CLUBS&mdash;OBSTACLE: </strong>The heroes encounter an obstacle of some kind and must figure out how to circumvent it. Some examples are a flooded river, minefields, a decaying rope bridge, whirlpool, etc. The obstacle might also be defended by creatures or enemies as well.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"blue-example\">Example: Irradiated Wastes</h2>\n<p>Red and Gabe are wasteland warriors in <cite>Deadlands: Hell on Earth</cite>, traversing an area outside of Las Vegas, Nevada, that&rsquo;s been blasted by nuclear &ldquo;ghost rock&rdquo; bombs.</p>\n<p>The GM draws a Jack of Clubs and decides the area is now a maze of jagged &ldquo;glass chasms&rdquo; and toxic sinkholes. This slows progress to a crawl for two days and makes them both roll for @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.疲乏]{疲乏} from heat and radiation (see the <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.危难]{危难}</strong> section).</p>\n<p>The GM draws again later that day and gets a Queen of Spades.

Vehicles can normally take three @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.伤害效果]{损伤} before they&rsquo;re <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.追逐与载具]{毁坏}</strong>, but Large Vehicles can take one additional Wound, Huge vehicles two, and Gargantuan three.</li>\n<li><strong>Handling: </strong>The vehicle&rsquo;s respons&shy;ive&shy;ness and maneuverability is added or subtracted from all its operator&rsquo;s maneuvering rolls (@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.驾船]{驾船}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.驾驶]{驾驶}, or @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.航空]{航空}). This typically ranges from &minus;4 for particularly slow or sluggish vehicles to +4 for those that can turn on a dime.</li>\n<li><strong>TOP SPEED: </strong>Top Speed is expressed in miles per hour (MPH) rather than @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.移动]{移速} &nbsp;so it&rsquo;s easier for you to look up real-world vehicles and use them in your game. The Chase rules only care about the relative speeds of vehicles anyway, not their actual speeds (see&nbsp;<strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.追逐与载具]{追逐}</strong>)\n<p>To convert miles per hour to @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.移动]{移速}, multiply MPH by 1.5. See the <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.追逐与载具]{Vehicles on the Tabletop sidebar}</strong>&nbsp;to integrate vehicles into tabletop combats with characters.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>TOUGHNESS: </strong> The vehicle&rsquo;s base durability including @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.护甲]{护甲} (in parentheses). Use the included vehicles as a guide (see @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Ground Vehicles]{Ground Vehicles}, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.船只 Table]{船只}, and @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.飞行器 Table]{飞行器}) when creating your own or writing up those that aren&rsquo;t listed here.\n<p>To estimate the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.护甲]{护甲} value of real world vehicles with Heavy Armor (tanks), start with +4 as a base, then add +2 for every inch of armor up to 10&Prime;, +1 per inch up to 20&Prime;, and finally +1 for every two <em>full</em> inches after that. A tank with 23&Prime; of armor, for example, has an Armor value of (4+20+10+1)=35.</p>\n<p>Adjust to reflect any other factors such as modern composite materials and the like.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>PASSENGERS: </strong>The number of crew plus any additional passengers it can transport. A notation of &ldquo;2+8,&rdquo; for example, means it requires a crew of two and can carry up to eight additional passengers.</li>\n<li><strong>COST: </strong>The average price of the vehicle.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Vehicle Notes</h2>\n<p><strong>Air Bags &amp; Safety Harnesses: </strong>Passengers with vehicular protective devices take half damage from collisions (round down). See&nbsp;<strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.追逐与载具]{毁坏}</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Amphibious:</strong> The vehicle can enter water without flooding or capsizing. See the individual descriptions for their movement rates while in water.</p>\n<p><strong>Anti-Missile Counter Measures (AMCM):</strong> AMCM systems are electronic jammers, chaff, and flares. They add +2 to a user&rsquo;s maneuvering rolls to evade missiles (see @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.导弹 Table]{导弹}).</p>\n<p><strong>Four-Wheel Drive (4WD):</strong> Treat each inch of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.移动]{困难地形} as 1.5&Prime; instead of 2&Prime;.</p>\n<p><strong>Heavy Armor:</strong> Only weapons marked as @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.重武器 (HW)]{重武器} can hurt this vehicle, regard&shy;less of the damage roll. This keeps a lucky pistol shot from destroying a tank. Vehicles with Heavy Armor halve damage they take from colliding with other obstacles (including vehicles) that don&rsquo;t have Heavy Armor.</p>\n<p>Unless otherwise specified, these vehicles have less protection on their sides and rear. Attacks that hit either (GM&rsquo;s call) increase the weapon&rsquo;s damage dice by one, thus 3d8 becomes 4d8, for example.</p>\n<p><strong>Hover:</strong> The vehicle is a hovercraft and can ignore most low terrain obstacles and water.</p>\n<p><strong>Infrared Night Vision:</strong> Thermal imaging devices halve @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.照明]{照明} penalties versus targets that give off heat.</p>\n<aside class=\"vehicle-notes-aside\">\n<h2>Converting from<br />previous editions</h2>\n<p>Vehicles in this list have slightly different statistics from previous editions:</p>\n<p><strong>Acceleration (&ldquo;Acc&rdquo;): </strong>Acceleration is now factored into Handling and Top Speed.</p>\n<p><strong>Climb: </strong>Climb has now been factored into each aircraft&rsquo;s Handling value.</p>\n<p><strong>Pace:</strong> @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.移动]{移速} in previous editions was based on &ldquo;tabletop&rdquo; speed and much lower than the values in this edition. To convert a real vehicle, look up its actual top speed in MPH. For fictional vehicles, mul&shy;tiply the <em>old</em> Top Speed by 3 to get its Top Speed in real world MPH.</p>\n</aside>\n<p><strong>Linked: </strong>Weapons of the same type may be dual or quad linked and fired as one (triple linked is ineffective). Dual linked weapons add +1 to hit and +2 damage; quad linked weapons add +2 to hit and +4 damage.</p>\n<p class=\"embedded-example\"><strong>Example:</strong> A pilot with d8 @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.射击]{射击} in a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.飞行器 Table]{喷火战斗机} (8&times; machine-guns, @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.射速]{射速} 3) rolls 3d8 for each wing, adding +2 to his Shooting total and +4 damage to those rounds that hit.</p>\n<p><strong>Night Vision:</strong> Various vehicular night vision systems eliminate Dim and Dark @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.照明]{照明} penalties as long as there is at least some amount of ambient light.</p>\n<p><strong>Reaction Fire: </strong>These weapons have special abilities in @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.追逐与载具]{追逐}.</p>\n<p><strong>Sloped Armor: </strong>Sloped armor deflects shots away from the hull. Direct-fire ballistic attacks against the vehicle, such as a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Ground Vehicles]{坦克} gun or @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Rocket Launchers and Torpedoes Table]{巴祖卡}, suffer a &minus;2 @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.射击]{射击} penalty.</p>\n<p><strong>Spacecraft: </strong> The vehicle is designed for use in outer space. Those noted as Atmospheric can enter and exit planetary atmospheres as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Stabilizer: </strong>A stabilizer reduces the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.不稳平台]{不稳平台} penalty for whatever weapon it&rsquo;s attached to (usually the main gun of a tank or armored vehicle). The penalty is reduced to &minus;1 for a Stabilizer and 0 for an Improved Stabilizer.</p>\n<p><strong>Stealth Paint: </strong>Radar-absorbent black paint makes the vehicle less detectable by sensors. @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.电子学]{电子学} rolls to spot or lock onto the target are made at &minus;4.</p>\n<p><strong>Tracked: </strong>Tracked vehicles can climb over most low obstacles such as logs or low rocks, and can push through snow, mud, and other slippery surfaces. They ignore movement penalties for @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.移动]{困难地形}.</p>\n<p><strong>Weapons: </strong>Vehicles with weapons note their location for narrative play and for the <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.追逐与载具]{追逐}</strong> rules. Here are the most common:</p>\n<ul class=\"red-bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>FIXED: </strong>The vehicle&rsquo;s weapon fires only in the listed direction (typically front or rear in a 45&deg; arc).</li>\n<li><strong>PINTILE MOUNT: </strong>A raised swivel mount that can fire in a 180&deg; arc to the listed direction. If mounted on the turret it must fire in the same facing as the turret each turn.</li>\n<li><strong>TURRET: </strong>The weapon is in a turret and has a 360&deg; arc of fire.</li>\n</ul>\n<img src=\"modules/swade-core-rules/assets/art/BicyleCrash.webp\" alt=\"Three kids on bicycles riding away from a large shadow monster.

			"description": "<div class=\"swade-core\">\n<div class=\"section-header\">\n<h1>Wealth</h1>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>The fight against evil can sometimes be expensive! The system here makes managing money in the game a bit easier and occasion&shy;ally dramatic.</p>\n<p><strong>When to Use These Rules:</strong> Use the Wealth system if you want a quick and easy way of handling financial resources without tracking actual currency.</p>\n<p><strong>The Basics:</strong> Characters have a new statistic called Wealth they can use to buy things. It increases when they&rsquo;re rewarded and decreases after significant purchases.</p>\n<h2>Buying Things</h2>\n<p>Each character has a d6 in Wealth, which represents average, middle class resources for the setting. This isn&rsquo;t a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性]{特性}, but acts like one&mdash;players may spend @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.助力点]{助力点} when checking it, get their @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性投骰]{Wild Die}, and benefit from allies&rsquo; @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.援助]{援助}.</p>\n<p>When a hero wants to buy something mundane, she does so&mdash;no roll is required. If the item is more than about $10 &times; her Wealth die, or she&rsquo;s made numerous recent trivial purchases, she must make a Wealth roll. The GM should add bonuses for savings or deals, subtract penalties for expensive purchases, or rule out all-together purchases beyond the character&rsquo;s means.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性投骰]{大失败} means the buyer can&rsquo;t scrape up the needed funds at the moment but may try again the next week, or after he obtains one or more <strong>Rewards</strong> (see below). With a regular failure, the buyer can either forgo the expense or she can buy it but goes broke (defined below) regardless of her Wealth die.</p>\n<p>Success means she purchases the item but her Wealth is reduced a die type until the GM feels her finances are restored by time or Rewards. A @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.特性投骰]{优良} means she buys the item without reducing her Wealth.</p>\n<h3>Going Broke</h3>\n<p>If a hero&rsquo;s Wealth would be reduced below d4, she&rsquo;s dead broke. She has basic food, water, and shelter (unless the GM and the situation dictate otherwise), but otherwise can&rsquo;t buy luxury foods, transportation, or even ammo.</p>\n<h3>Poor or Rich Characters</h3>\n<p>Wealth is only permanently increased by Rewards or the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-edges.富裕]{富裕} @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.专长]{专长. It&rsquo;s decreased through use and the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-hindrances.贫穷]{贫穷} @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.负赘]{负赘}. Those with the Poverty Hindrance have a d4 Wealth. Rich characters have a d8, and Very Rich heroes have a d10.</p>\n<p>Heroes with the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-edges.小有名气]{小有名气} Edge add +1 to their Wealth rolls or +2 if they&rsquo;re Famous. Not only do they tend to have more money, but people love to give discounts to celebrities.</p>\n<h3>Support Rolls</h3>\n<p>Other characters may @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.援助]{援助} a hero&rsquo;s Wealth roll, but assume the same risks as the buyer (losing a die type in Wealth with success, for example).</p>\n<h2>Availability</h2>\n<p>If an item isn&rsquo;t commonly available, finding it on the black market, via a private dealer, or in an internet chat room requires the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.调查]{调查} skill or <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.打点关系]{打点关系}</strong>.</p>\n<p>The GM can also simply decide the item isn&rsquo;t available or she can assign a modifier to the hero&rsquo;s roll as she sees fit. Finding a firearm in modern-day Europe, for example, is at least a &minus;4 penalty, with serious consequences if the roll is failed.</p>\n<h2>Rewards</h2>\n<p>Getting paid for a job or finding treasure increases the characters&rsquo; Wealth die one step for an average task, two for a particularly lucrative reward, or three for a very great reward.</p>\n<p>Rewards and cost of living are relative, so the increase lasts only for a month of game time or until the GM thinks the party&rsquo;s lifestyle, carousing, or general living expenses restores it to normal.</p>\n<aside class=\"graph_quarter\">\n<h2>Negotiating</h2>\n<p>Players love to negotiate with those who hire them, but an increase in cash rarely means anything in actual gameplay. Using this system means a successful negotiation, as well as bounties and rewards, gives them a tangible bonus to their finances.</p>\n<p>At least for a while!</p>\n</aside>\n</div>\n</div>"

Skytch the Dragon is also a Wild Card, though his three young wyrms aren&rsquo;t.</p>\n<p>Wild Cards are those who have stepped up to do more than most.
